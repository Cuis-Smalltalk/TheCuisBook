@node Installing and configuring @cuis{}
@section Installing and configuring @cuis{}
@cuis{} is an environment and a programming language executed on a
virtual computer. Therefore it is essentially based on two components:
the Smalltalk @dfn{virtual machine} conceptualizing this virtual
computer and an @dfn{image} representing the state of this computer.

The virtual machine is an executable program running on a dedicated
host (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, etc.). It is called the @dfn{Open
Smalltalk Virtual Machine}, or Squeak @vm{} in short. There are
different flavors of @vm{}, one for each combination of Operating
System and CPU architecture. Therefore, one @vm{} compiled
for Windows in Intel architecture will not work on Linux in
ARM architecture. You need the specific @vm{} compiled for
the combination of Operating System and CPU architecture
your computer is based on.

The image is a regular file feeding the @vm{} with all the objects
 defining the state of the virtual computer. These objects are
 classes, methods, instances of those classes as numbers, strings,
 windows, debuggers whatever existed when the state of the virtual
 computer was saved. An image file saved on a given Operating System
 and CPU architecture run identically on another system as
 long as the same @vm{} version is used.

What makes @cuis{} special is the living entities in the image: its
classes population and arrangement, how they inherit from each
other. The @cuis{} moto is to be a tiny, coherent and human
understandable Smalltalk environment; its class population is inferior
to 500.

To get you started easily, @url{http://cuis-Smalltalk/BooResources,we
provide three archives} for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows on Intel
architecture. These archives come with the dedicated @vm{} and the
image of @cuis{} @value{cuisVersion}. Into this image we pre-installed
a few packages to make your life easier when you experience the
examples and exercises of the book. At the reading time of this book,
@cuis{} has likely evolved with a more recent version, nevertheless
your learning is transferable to more recent version of @cuis{}.

To get @cuis{} running on your computer, follow the instructions in
the @file{README} file accompanying the archive. Once you get @cuis{}
running, read the information displayed on the windows. When you are
done, close these windows, next you will adjust @cuis{} to your
preferences.

@subsection Editing your preferences
Once you read the instructions on the default windows, the second
things you want to do is to adjust its visual properties to fit your
preferences and needs. To do so, access the World menu
...@clicksequence{Background click @click{} Preferences...} then
select the pin on the top right of the menu to make it permanent. Here
you have the most important options: the choice for the @strong{font
size}, the @strong{themes} whenever your prefer light or dark
colouring. There are other preferences you can explore by
yourself. Once you are done, access again the World menu
...@clicksequence{Background click @click{} Save}... to make your
preferences permanent. In this book, we keep the default @cuis{}
theme, we suggest you to do the same so your environment reflects the
book screenshots.

@subsection Fun with windows placement
@cindex tools, workspace
The first tool to discover is the @dfn{Workspace} tool. It is a kind
of text editor to key in Smalltalk code you can execute
immediately. Do a ...@clicksequence{Background click @click{}
Open... @click{} Workspace}...

Now we ask @cuis{} to make the windows placement: click the blue icon
(top left) to access the window option and experiment with the white
area to place the Workspace window at the half left of the @cuis{}
environment.

@figure{Window options,B-01-img1,7}

The @option{resize...} option even offers more freedom to place the
window. Resolve the following exercise:

@exercise{Middle placement,exePlacement, @emph{Use the
@option{resize...} option to place the Workspace centered on @cuis{}
environment.}}

@node Writing your first scripts
@section Writing your first scripts
In this section we present a few scripts so you will get a taste and
feeling about Smalltalk code. The examples are completed with small
exercises to experiment with and accompanied with solutions in the
annex. We intentionally keep the details of the syntax out of this
section.

Smalltalk script are usually written in a Workspace. The usual
@emph{Hello world!} program is written as:

@smalltalkExampleCaption{The traditional 'Hello World!' program,hello,
Transcript show: 'Hello World'}

@cindex tools, transcript
To execute this code, select it with the mouse and
...@clicksequence{right mouse click @click{} Do it (d)}...  Nothing
happen! Indeed to see the output, you need a @dfn{Transcript} window,
it is a place where programmer send information for the user as we are
doing in our example. Do ...@clicksequence{Background click @click{}
Open... @click{} Transcript}... and execute again the code.

@figure{Transcript window with output,B-01-img2,3}

This code comes in three parts:

@itemize

@item the literal @smalltalk{'Hello World!'}  

@item the message @msg{show:} with its argument @smalltalk{'Hello World!'}

@item the class @class{Transcript} receiving the message @msg{show:} with its argument

@end itemize

The action of printing takes place in the class
@class{Transcript}. The code execution is invoked with keyboard
shortcuts @kbd{Ctrl-A} then @kbd{Ctrl-D} (@emph{@b{D}o it}).

@smalltalkExampleCaption{Multiple lines, hello2,
Transcript show: 'Hello World!'.
Transcript newLine.
Transcript show: 'I am Cuising'}

In this three lines script, observe how the line are separated by a
dot ``.''. It is really a line separator not needed in the third line
nor in a one line script. The message @msg{newLine} has no argument.

@cindex cascade of messages
In the @ref{hello2} example, the message @msg{show:} and @msg{newLine}
are sent to the same @class{Transcript} class. In such circumstance,
we can use the cascade technique to avoid this repetition. The
receiver @class{Transcript} is written once and the sent messages are
separated by semicolon:

@smalltalkExampleCaption{Cascade of message, helloCascade,
Transcript
   show: 'Hello World!';
   newLine;
   show: 'I am Cuising'}

Observe the text layout to ease code understanding. It is possible to
write the cascade of messages in one line, but it reduces the
readability of the code:

@smalltalkExample{Transcript show: 'Hello World!'; newLine; show: 'I
am Cuising'}

The @class{Transcript} class is most of the time used to output useful
information when developing an application. As an alternative to the
@kbd{Ctrl-d} shortcut, @kbd{Ctrl-p} (@emph{@b{P}rint it}) executes the
script and prints in the Workspace the result of the last line of the
script.

@subsection Fun with numbers
@cindex number, integer

In your Workspace, to compute a factorial execute the example bellow
with @kbd{Ctrl-a} then @kbd{Ctrl-p}:
@smalltalkExample{100 factorial
@result{}  9332621544394415268169923885626670049071596826438162146859
29638952175999932299156089414639761565182862536979208272237582
51185210916864000000000000000000000000}

@cuis{} handles very large integer number without the need to use
special type or method. To convince yourelf try the example bellow:
@smalltalkExample{10000 factorial / 9999 factorial
@result{} 10000}

If you execute and print with @kbd{Ctrl-p} @smalltalk{10000
factorial}, you realize it takes far more time to print one factorial
than computing two factorials and a division. The result is an integer
as expected, not a decimal number answer as many computer languages
will return.

As we are discussing division, you may not get the result you think:
@smalltalkExample{15 / 4 @result{} 15/4}

It looks like @cuis{} is lazy because it does not respond the decimal
number @smalltalk{3.75} as we were expecting. In fact @cuis{} wants to
be as accurate as possible, and its answer is a fraction number! After
all, fraction number are just division we are too lazy -- because it
is troublesome -- to compute, @cuis{} does just that!

Try out this to understand what is happening underneath:
@smalltalkExample{(15 / 4) + (1 / 4) @result{} 4}

Is it not wonderful? @cuis{} computes with rational numbers. We
started with division and addition operations on integer, and we got
an accurate result thanks to intermediate computation on rational
numbers.

@cuisNote{In the example, observe how the parenthesis are used
although in arithmetic calculus the division is operated first. With
@cuis{} you need to explicit the order of operation with
parenthesis. We will explain why in Part Two.}

@exercise{Inverse sum,inverseSum, @emph{Write the code to compute the
sum of the first four integer inverses.}}

All four arithmetic operations and mathematical functions are
compatible with the rational number representation:
@smalltalkExample {(15 / 14) * (21 / 5) @result{} 9 / 2
(15 / 14) / ( 5 / 21) @result{} 9 /2 
(3 / 4) squared @result{} 9 / 16
(25 / 4) sqrt @result{} 5 / 2}

@exercise{Sum of the squares,squaredSum,Write the code to compute the
sum of the squares of the inverse of the first four integers.}

@cindex number, decimal division
If @cuis{} divide integer as rational number, how do we compute the
decimal division? One option is to write a number as a
@dfn{Float}, it is the decimal representation in programming language:
@smalltalkExample{
15.0 / 4 @result{} 3.75 
15 / 4.0 @result{} 3.75}

Another option is to convert an integer to a float with the
@msg{asFloat} message. It is very useful when the integer is in a
variable:

@smalltalkExample{15 asFloat / 4 @result{} 3.75}

@cindex number, integer division
Alternatively to the decimal division, you ask integer division with
the message @msg{//}:
@smalltalkExample{15 // 4 @result{} 3}

@cindex number, division reminder
The reminder of the Euclidean division is computed with the message
@msg{\\\\\\}:
@smalltalkExample{15 \\\\\ 4 @result{} 3}


@cindex number, odd
@cindex number, even
@cindex number, prime
@cuis{} knows some arithmetic operations to test if an integer is an
odd, even or prime number. You just send the appropriate message to
the number:

@smalltalkExampleCaption{Testing on integer,integerBasicTest,
25 odd                             
@result{} true
25 even
@result{} false
25 isPrime
@result{} false
23 isPrime
@result{} true}

@cindex number, gcd
@cindex number, lcm
With specific @dfn{keyword messages} you compute the Least Common
Multiple and Greatest Common Divisor. A keyword message is composed of
one or several colon(s) ``:'' to insert argument(s):

@smalltalkExample{12 lcm: 15 @result{} 60

12 gcd: 15 @result{} 3}
Integer can be printed in different forms:

@cindex number, roman
@cindex number, as words
@cindex number, base
@smalltalkExample{
2020 printStringRoman @result{} 'MMXX' 
2020 printStringWords  @result{} 'two thousand, twenty'
"Number as the Maya did"
2020 printStringBase: 20 @result{} '510'}


@subsubheading Hiatus with decimal numbers
@cindex number, decimal
Decimal numbers are written with a dot ``.'' to separate the integer
and the decimal parts: @smalltalk{1.5}, @smalltalk{1235.021} or
@smalltalk{0.5}. The number @smalltalk{0.00004} is more easily written
@smalltalk{4e-5}; it means 4 preceded by 5 zeros or 4 as the fifth
digit after the decimal dot.

@strong{Attention.} Computer represents decimal number
imprecisely. You need to be aware of that when doing computation and
equality comparison. Most system hides these errors because there are
very tiny errors. @cuis{} does not hide these inaccuracy.

@smalltalkExampleCaption{Computer dyscalculia!,FloatPrecision,
0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3
@result{} 5.551115123125783e-17}

In @ref{FloatPrecision}, the returned value should be zero but it is
not the case. The computer returns @smalltalk{5.55e-17}, or
@smalltalk{0.0000000000000000555}, it is very close to zero, but there
is an error.

@exercise{Miscellaneous calculus errors with decimal
number,exeFloatPrecision,@emph{Give 3 calculus showing errors compare
to the expected results.}}

When accuracy is absolutely mandatory use the Rational Numbers
representation of @cuis{}.

@cindex number, rational
@cindex number, fraction
A rational number is written with the division symbol between two
integers: do @kbd{Ctrl-p} on @smalltalk{5/2} @result{}
@smalltalk{5/2}. @cuis{} returns a fraction, it does note compute a
decimal.

@exercise{Toward the infinite,exeZeroDivide, @emph{What happen when
executing this code} @smalltalk{5/0}@emph{?}}

Let's come back to our computer dyscalculia with decimal numbers. When
using the rational numbers, the @ref{FloatPrecision} becomes:

@smalltalkExampleCaption{Right with fraction!,FractionPrecision,
(1/10) + (2/10) - (3/10)
@result{} 0}

This time we have the expected result. Underneath the computer only
does calculus with integers.

@exercise{Fix the errors,exeFractionPrecision, @emph{Return to
@ref{exeFloatPrecision} and use rational writing to represent decimal
numbers. The errors are gone.}}

@cuis{} knows how to convert a decimal number as a fraction, by
sending the message @msg{asFraction}. We already acknowledged the
computer dyscalculia trouble with decimal number, this is why when
asking for a fraction representation we have this strange answer. The
internal computer represenation of @smalltalk{1.3} is not exactly it:

@smalltalkExample{1.3 asFraction
@result{} 5854679515581645/45035996273704}

@subsection Fun with text
@cindex string
A @dfn{String} is the way text are represented in programming
language, it is a collection of characters. We already met string with
our first script, it is enclosed in double quotes ``"'':
@smalltalk{"hello world!"}. We capitalize it with the @msg{capitalized}:

@cindex string, capitalized
@smalltalkExample{'hello world!' capitalized @result{} 'Hello world!' }

@exercise{Capitalize number as words,capWordNumber,@emph{Print 2020 as
words capitalized.}}

@subsection Fun with collection
To get an unordered set of natural numbers from 0 to 100, do
@kbd{Ctrl-a} then @kbd{Ctrl-p} on the following code:

@smalltalkExample{(1 to: 100) asArray
@result{} #(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68
69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91
92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100)}

In this line of code, the message @msg{to:} is sent to @smalltalk{1}
with the argument @smalltalk{100}. It returns an interval object. The
message @msg{asArray} sent to the interval returns an array.

@exercise{Negative integer numbers,exeNegativeIntegers,@emph{Create an
array of integer numbers ranging from -80 to 50.}}


To select the prime number from 1 to 100, we use one of the numerous
enumerate @cuis{} methods:

@smalltalkExampleCaption{Select prime number between 1 and 100,primber100,
(1 to: 100) select: [:n | n isPrime]
@result{}  #(2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71
73 79 83 89 97)}

This example introduces the message @msg{select:} and an important
constituting element of @cuis{}: the block of code between square
brackets. A block of code is a piece of code for later
execution(s). Let's explain how this script is executed:

@itemize

 @item @smalltalk{(1 to: 100)} is evaluated as an interval

 @item the block of code @smalltalk{[:n | n isPrime]} is instantiated

 @item the message @msg{select:} is sent to the interval with the
 block of code as argument

 @item for each integer of the interval, the block of code is executed
 with the argument @smalltalk{n} taking the integer value. Then, each
 time the @smalltalk{n isPrime} returns true, the @smalltalk{n} value
 is selected in a collection to be returned at the end of the
 @smalltalk{select:} method.

@end itemize

45.}
