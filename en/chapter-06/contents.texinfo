@chapter Visual With Morph

Every object you see in @cuis{} is a @class{Morph} or is composed
of @class{Morph}s.  Basically, a @class{Morph} is an object with
state and behavior that can also depict itself on a computer
display screen.

Because Morphs are useful you can look at
class @class{Morph} in a Hierarchy Browser, and you will
see a large number of methods and many subclasses.
But the basic ideas are quite simple.
