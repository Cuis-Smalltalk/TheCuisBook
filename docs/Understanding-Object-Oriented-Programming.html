<span id="Understanding-Object-Oriented-Programming-1"></span><h3 class="section">3.1 Understanding Object Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>Cuis-Smalltalk is a pure object oriented programming language (OOP): all the
entities as integer, float, rational number, string and other like
collection, block of code we have not yet learnt about are objects.
</p>
<p>But what is an object?  An object is an entity responding to two
criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>An internal state.</strong> It is embodied by variable(s)
   known only by the object. A variable only visible within the object
   is called <em>private</em>. As a consequence, it is impossible &ndash; if
   the object decides so &ndash; to know the internal state of the object
   from another object.

</li><li> <strong>A behavior.</strong> It is modeled by message(s) &ndash; we
   already used this vocabulary &ndash; sent to the object. When the object
   receives a message it understands, it executes the code of an
   internal method named as the message.

</li></ul>
<span id="index-class"></span>
<span id="index-subclass"></span>
<span id="index-instance"></span>

<p>Several entities sharing the same variables and understanding the same messages
are very likely to exist within Cuis-Smalltalk &ndash; think about the
numbers. Therefore, entities are created &ndash; <em>instantiated</em> &ndash;
following a model, this model is called a <em>Class</em>.
</p>

<span id="index-variable-_0028instance_0029"></span>
<span id="index-instance-variable"></span>
<p>A given class declares its internal variables &ndash; states &ndash; and the
behavior by implementing the methods. Let see how the <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>
class is declared:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Number subclass: #Fraction
   instanceVariableNames: &rsquo;numerator denominator&rsquo;
   classVariableNames: &rdquo;
   poolDictionaries: &rdquo;
   category: &rsquo;Kernel-Numbers&rsquo;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As expected there are two variables &ndash; named <em>instance variables</em>
&ndash; to define the <span class="sansserif">numerator</span> and <span class="sansserif">denominator</span> of
a fraction. From this declaration, we observe there is a hierarchy in
the class definition: <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> is a kind of
<span class="sansserif">Number</span>. This means a fraction inherits the internal state &ndash;
variables &ndash; and behavior &ndash; methods &ndash; defined in the <span class="sansserif">Number</span>
class. <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> is called a <em>subclass</em> of <span class="sansserif">Number</span>.
</p>
<span id="index-class_002c-inheritance"></span>
<p>A Class specifies the behavior of all of its instances.  It is useful 
to be able to say &quot;this object is like that object, but for these differences&quot;.  
We do this in Smalltalk by a Class inheriting instance state and behavior from 
its parent Class.  This child, or subclass then specifies just the
instance state and behavior which is different from its parent.
</p>
<p>This aspect of object oriented programming is called
<em>inheritance</em>. In Cuis-Smalltalk, each class inherits from one parent
class.
</p>
<p>In Smalltalk, each object decides for itself how it reponds to a message.
This is called <em>polymorphism</em>.
The same message selector may be sent to objects of different Classes.  
The &rsquo;shape&rsquo; (morph) of the computation is different depending on the specific 
class of the &rsquo;many&rsquo; (poly) possible classes of the object receiving the message.
</p>
<p>We saw above that different kinds of objects
all responded to the same #printString message in different,
but appropriate ways.
</p>
<span id="index-instance_002c-creation"></span>
<span id="index-class_002c-class-method"></span>
<p>In the previous section, we already met fraction. Those fractions are
objects called <em>instance</em> of the class <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>. To create
this instance we wrote <span class="sansserif">5 / 4</span>, the mechanism is based on
message sending and polymorphism. The number <span class="sansserif">5</span> is an
integer receiving the message <span class="sansserif">#/</span>, therefore looking at the method
<span class="sansserif">/</span> in the <span class="sansserif">Integer</span> class explains how is instantiated
the fraction. See part of this method:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">/ aNumber
&quot;Refer to the comment in Number / &quot;
| quoRem |
aNumber isInteger ifTrue:
../..
   ifFalse: [^ (Fraction numerator: self denominator: aNumber) reduced]].
../..</span>
</pre></div>

<p>From this source code, we learn that in some situation, the method
returns a fraction, reduced. We can expect that in some other
situation an integer is returned, for example <span class="sansserif">6 / 2</span>.
</p>
<p>In the example, we observe the message <span class="sansserif">#numerator:denominator:</span> is
sent to the class <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>, such a message refers to a
<em>class method</em> understood only by the <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> class. It
is expected such a named method returns an instance of a
<span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>.
</p>
<p>Try out in a workspace:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Fraction numerator: 24 denominator: 21
&rArr; 24/21</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Observe how the fraction is not reduced. Whereas it is, when
instantiated with the <span class="sansserif">#/</span> message:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">24 / 21
&rArr; 8/7</span>
</pre></div>

<p>A class method is often used to create a new instance from a class. In
&lsquo;forLoop&rsquo;, the message <span class="sansserif">#new</span> is sent to the class
<span class="sansserif">OrderedCollection</span> to create a new empty collection;
<span class="sansserif">new</span> is a class method.
</p>
<p>In &lsquo;repeatLoop&rsquo;, the <span class="sansserif">#newFrom:</span> message is sent to the class
<span class="sansserif">OrdredCollection</span> to create a new collection filled with
elements from the array given in argument; <span class="sansserif">newFrom:</span> is
another class method.
</p>
<span id="index-class_002c-instance-method-1"></span>
<span id="index-polymorphism"></span>
<span id="index-number_002c-_0023squared"></span>
<p>Now observe the hierarchy of the Number class:
</p>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><span class="sansserif">Number</span>
   <span class="sansserif">Float</span>
      <span class="sansserif">BoxedFloat64</span>
      <span class="sansserif">SmallFloat64</span>
   <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>
   <span class="sansserif">Integer</span>
      <span class="sansserif">LargePositiveInteger</span>
         <span class="sansserif">LargeNegativeInteger</span>
      <span class="sansserif">SmalltalkInteger</span>
</pre></div>

<p><span class="sansserif">Float</span>, <span class="sansserif">Integer</span> and <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> are direct
descendants of the <span class="sansserif">Number</span> class. We already learnt about the
<span class="sansserif">#squared</span> message sent to integer and fraction instances:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">16 squared &rArr; 256
(2 / 3) squared &rArr; 4/9</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As the <span class="sansserif">#squared</span> message is sent to <span class="sansserif">Integer</span> and
<span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> instances, the associated <span class="sansserif">squared</span> method is
called an <em>instance method</em>. This method is defined in both the
<span class="sansserif">Number</span> and <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> classes.
</p>
<span id="index-method_002c-returned-value-_0028explicit_0029"></span>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine this method in <span class="sansserif">Number</span>:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Number&gt;&gt;squared
&quot;Answer the receiver multiplied by itself.&quot;
   ^self * self</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In an instance method source code, <span class="sansserif">self</span> refers to the
object itself, here it is the value of the number. The <span class="sansserif">^</span>
symbol indicates to return the following value <span class="sansserif">self *
self</span>.
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s examine this same method in <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Fraction&gt;&gt;squared
   ^ Fraction
      numerator: numerator squared
      denominator: denominator squared</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here a new fraction is instantiated with numerator and denominator
squared. This alternate <span class="sansserif">squared</span> method, ensure a fraction is
returned.
</p>
<span id="index-method_002c-overriding"></span>
<span id="index-overriding"></span>
<p>When message <span class="sansserif">#squared</span> is sent to a number, different methods are
executed depending on the number is a fraction or any other kind of
number. This fundamental mechanism of oriented object programming is
called <em>Polymorphism</em>. More precisely, the <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> class
is <em>overriding</em> the <span class="sansserif">squared</span> method, defined above in the
class hierarchy.
</p>
<span id="index-number_002c-_0023abs"></span>
<p>Still in the <span class="sansserif">Number</span> hierarchy, let&rsquo;s examine another example
of polymorphism with the <span class="sansserif">#abs</span> message:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">-10 abs &rArr; 10
5.3 abs &rArr; 5.3
(-5 / 3) abs &rArr; 5/3</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The implementation in <span class="sansserif">Number</span> does not need much
explanation. There is the <span class="sansserif">#ifTrue:ifFalse:</span> we have not yet
discussed so far, but the code is quite self-explanatory:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Number&gt;&gt;abs
&quot;Answer a Number that is the absolute value (positive magnitude) of the 
receiver.&quot;
   self &lt; 0
      ifTrue: [^self negated]
      ifFalse: [^self]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This implementation will do just fine for the <span class="sansserif">Number</span>
subclasses. Nevertheless, there are several classes overriding it for
optimization purpose.
</p>
<span id="index-method_002c-returned-value-_0028default_0029"></span>
<p>For example, regarding large positive integer, <span class="sansserif">abs</span> is
empty. Indeed, in the absence of explicitly returned value, the
default returned value is the instance itself, in our situation the
<span class="sansserif">LargePositiveInteger</span> instance:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">LargePositiveInteger&gt;&gt;abs</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <span class="sansserif">LargeNegativeInteger</span> counter part compute the opposite
with <span class="sansserif">#negated</span> message:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">LargeNegativeInteger&gt;&gt;abs
   ^ self negated</span>
</pre></div>
   
<p>These two overriding methods are more efficient as they avoid test and
ifTrue/ifFalse branches. Polymorphism is often used to avoid test and
branching, it is done at the object level.
</p>
<p>As an object is modeled against a class, it is possible to ask its
class with the <span class="sansserif">#class</span> message. Observe carefully the class
returned in line 2 and 3:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="askingClass"></span>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">1 class &rArr; SmallInteger 
(1/3) class &rArr; Fraction 
(6/2) class &rArr; SmallInteger 
(1/3) asFloat class  &rArr; SmallFloat64 
(1.0/3) class &rArr; SmallFloat64 
&rsquo;Hello&rsquo; class &rArr; String 
(&rsquo;Hello&rsquo; at: 1) class &rArr; Character</span>
</pre></div>
