<span id="Understanding-Object-Oriented-Programming-1"></span><h3 class="section">3.1 Understanding Object Oriented Programming</h3>

<p>But just what is an object?
</p>
<p>At its simplest, an object has two components:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Internal state.</strong> This is embodied by variable(s)
   known only by the object. A variable only visible within the object
   is called <em>private</em>. As a consequence, it is impossible &ndash; if
   the object decides so &ndash; to know the internal state of the object
   from another object.

</li><li> <strong>A repertoire of behaviors.</strong> These are the message(s)
   an object instance responds to. When the object
   receives a message it understands, it gets its behavior from a
   method with that name known by its class or superclass.

</li></ul>
<span id="index-class"></span>
<span id="index-subclass"></span>
<span id="index-instance"></span>
<span id="index-selector"></span>

<p>The method name is called a <em>selector</em> because it is used to select
which behavior is invoked. For example, in <code>'hello' at: 1 put: $B</code>,
the method invoked has the selector <code>#at:put:</code> and the arguments
<code>1</code> and <code>$B</code>.  All selectors are symbols.
</p>
<p>Object instances are created &ndash; <em>instantiated</em> &ndash;
following a model or template. This model is known by its <em>Class</em>.
All instances of a class share the same methods and so react in the same ways.
</p>
<p>For example, there is one class <code>Fraction</code> but many
fractions (1/2, 1/3, 23/17, ...) which all behave the way
we expect fractions to behave.  Class <code>Fraction</code>
and the classes it inherits from define this common behavior,
as we will now describe.
</p>

<span id="index-variable-_0028instance_0029"></span>
<span id="index-instance-variable"></span>
<p>A given class declares its internal variables &ndash; states &ndash; and the
behavior by implementing the methods.  A variable is basically a named
box which can hold any object.  Each instance of a class gets its own
box with the common name.
</p>
<p>Let see how the <code>Fraction</code>
class is declared:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Number subclass: #Fraction
   instanceVariableNames: &rsquo;numerator denominator&rsquo;
   classVariableNames: &rdquo;
   poolDictionaries: &rdquo;
   category: &rsquo;Kernel-Numbers&rsquo;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As expected there are two variables &ndash; named <em>instance variables</em>
&ndash; to define the <code>numerator</code> and <code>denominator</code> of
a fraction.  Each instance of fraction has its own numerator and its
own denominator.
</p>
<span id="index-superclass"></span>
<p>From this declaration, we observe there is a hierarchy in
the class definition: <code>Fraction</code> is a kind of
<code>Number</code>. This means a fraction inherits the internal state &ndash;
variables &ndash; and behavior &ndash; methods &ndash; defined in the <code>Number</code>
class. <code>Fraction</code> is called a <em>subclass</em> of <code>Number</code>,
and so naturally we call <code>Number</code> a <em>superclass</em> of <code>Fraction</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-class_002c-inheritance"></span>
<p>A Class specifies the behavior of all of its instances.  It is useful 
to be able to say &quot;this object is like that object, but for
these differences&quot;.  
We do this in Smalltalk by a Class inheriting instance state and behavior from 
its parent Class.  This child, or subclass then specifies just the
instance state and behavior which is different from its parent.
</p>
<p>This aspect of object oriented programming is called
<em>inheritance</em>. In Cuis-Smalltalk, each class inherits from one parent
class.
</p>
<p>In Smalltalk, we say that each object decides for itself
how it reponds to a message.
This is called <em>polymorphism</em>.
The same message selector may be sent to objects of different Classes.  
The &rsquo;shape&rsquo; (morph) of the computation is different depending on the specific 
class of the &rsquo;many&rsquo; (poly) possible classes of the object receiving the message.
</p>
<p>We saw above that different kinds of objects
all responded to the same #printString message in different,
but appropriate ways.
</p>
<span id="index-instance_002c-creation"></span>
<span id="index-class_002c-class-method"></span>
<p>We have already met fractions. Those fractions are
objects called <em>instance</em>s of the class <code>Fraction</code>. To create
an instance we wrote <code>5 / 4</code>, the mechanism is based on
message sending and polymorphism.  Let us look into how this works.
</p>
<p>The number <code>5</code> is an
integer receiving the message <code>#/</code>, therefore looking at the method
<code>/</code> in the <code>Integer</code> class explains how is instantiated
the fraction. See part of this method:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">/ aNumber
&quot;Refer to the comment in Number / &quot;
| quoRem |
aNumber isInteger ifTrue:
../..
   ifFalse: [^ (Fraction numerator: self denominator: aNumber) reduced]].
../..</span>
</pre></div>

<p>From this source code, we learn that in some situations, the method
returns a fraction, reduced. We can expect that in some other
situation an integer is returned, for example <code>6 / 2</code>.
</p>
<p>In the example, we observe the message <code>#numerator:denominator:</code> is
sent to the class <code>Fraction</code>, such a message refers to a
<em>class method</em> understood only by the <code>Fraction</code> class. It
is expected such a named method returns an instance of a
<code>Fraction</code>.
</p>
<p>Try out in a workspace:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Fraction numerator: 24 denominator: 21
&rArr; 24/21</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Observe how the fraction is not reduced. Whereas it is, when
instantiated with the <code>#/</code> message:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">24 / 21
&rArr; 8/7</span>
</pre></div>

<p>A class method is often used to create a new instance from a class. In
<a href="Fun-with-collections.html#forLoop">Example 4.7</a>, the message <code>#new</code> is sent to the class
<code>OrderedCollection</code> to create a new empty collection;
<em><code>new</code></em> is a class method.
</p>
<p>In <a href="Fun-with-collections.html#repeatLoop">Example 4.8</a>, the <code>#newFrom:</code> message is sent to the class
<code>OrderedCollection</code> to create a new collection filled with
elements from the array given in argument; <em><code>newFrom:</code></em> is
another class method.
</p>
<span id="index-class_002c-instance-method-1"></span>
<span id="index-polymorphism"></span>
<span id="index-number_002c-squared-1"></span>
<p>Now observe the hierarchy of the Number class:
</p>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><code>Number</code>
   <code>Float</code>
      <code>BoxedFloat64</code>
      <code>SmallFloat64</code>
   <code>Fraction</code>
   <code>Integer</code>
      <code>LargePositiveInteger</code>
         <code>LargeNegativeInteger</code>
      <code>SmallInteger</code>
</pre></div>

<p><code>Float</code>, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Fraction</code> are direct
descendants of the <code>Number</code> class. We have already learned about the
<code>#squared</code> message sent to integer and fraction instances:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">16 squared &rArr; 256
(2 / 3) squared &rArr; 4/9</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As the <code>#squared</code> message is sent to <code>Integer</code> and
<code>Fraction</code> instances, the associated <code>squared</code> method is
called an <em>instance method</em>. This method is defined in both the
<code>Number</code> and <code>Fraction</code> classes.
</p>
<span id="index-method_002c-returned-value-_0028explicit_0029"></span>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine this method in <code>Number</code>:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Number&gt;&gt;squared
&quot;Answer the receiver multiplied by itself.&quot;
   ^self * self</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In an instance method source code, <code>self</code> refers to the
object itself, here it is the value of the number. The <code>^</code>
symbol indicates to return the following value <code>self *
self</code>.
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s examine this same method in <code>Fraction</code>:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Fraction&gt;&gt;squared
   ^ Fraction
      numerator: numerator squared
      denominator: denominator squared</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here a new fraction is instantiated with the original instance
numerator and denominator being squared.
This alternate <code>squared</code> method, ensures a fraction instance is
returned.
</p>
<span id="index-method_002c-overriding"></span>
<span id="index-overriding"></span>
<p>When message <code>#squared</code> is sent to a number, different methods are
executed depending on the number is a fraction or another other kind of
number. Polymorphism means that the Class of each instance decides
how it will repond to a particular message.
Here, the <code>Fraction</code> class
is <em>overriding</em> the <code>squared</code> method, defined above in the
class hierarchy.  If a method is not overridden, an inherited method
is invoked to respond to the message.
</p>
<span id="index-number_002c-abs"></span>
<p>Still in the <code>Number</code> hierarchy, let&rsquo;s examine another example
of polymorphism with the <code>#abs</code> message:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">-10 abs &rArr; 10
5.3 abs &rArr; 5.3
(-5 / 3) abs &rArr; 5/3</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The implementation in <code>Number</code> does not need much
explanation. There is the <code>#ifTrue:ifFalse:</code> we have not yet
discussed so far, but the code is quite self-explanatory:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Number&gt;&gt;abs
&quot;Answer a Number that is the absolute value (positive magnitude) of the 
receiver.&quot;
   self &lt; 0
      ifTrue: [^self negated]
      ifFalse: [^self]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This implementation will do just fine for the <code>Number</code>
subclasses. Nevertheless, there are several classes overriding it for
specialized or optimized cases.
</p>
<span id="index-method_002c-returned-value-_0028default_0029"></span>
<p>For example, regarding large positive integer, <code>abs</code> is
empty. Indeed, <strong>in the absence of explicitly returned value, the
default returned value is the instance itself</strong>, in our situation the
<code>LargePositiveInteger</code> instance:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">LargePositiveInteger&gt;&gt;abs</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>LargeNegativeInteger</code> knows it is negative and its absolute value must be 
itself but with its sign reversed, that is <code>negated</code>:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">LargeNegativeInteger&gt;&gt;abs
   ^ self negated</span>
</pre></div>
   
<p>These two overriding methods are more efficient as they avoid test and
ifTrue/ifFalse branches. Polymorphism is often used to avoid test and
branch.
</p>
<p><strong>Tip.</strong> If you select the text <code>abs</code>
in a Browser or Workspace
and right-click to get the context menu, you will find
an entry <code>Implementors of it</code>.
You can select this or use <kbd>Ctrl-m</kbd> (<em>i<b>M</b>plementors</em>) to
see how various methods for <code>#abs</code> use polymorphism to
specialize their answer to produce the naturally expected result.
</p>
<p>As an object instance is modeled by its class, it is possible to
ask any object its
class with the <code>#class</code> message. Observe carefully the class
returned in line 2 and 3:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="askingClass"></span>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">1 class &rArr; SmallInteger 
(1/3) class &rArr; Fraction 
(6/2) class &rArr; SmallInteger 
(1/3) asFloat class  &rArr; SmallFloat64 
(1.0/3) class &rArr; SmallFloat64 
&rsquo;Hello&rsquo; class &rArr; String 
(&rsquo;Hello&rsquo; at: 1) class &rArr; Character</span>
</pre></div>
