<span id="Understanding-Object-Oriented-Programming-1"></span><h3 class="section">3.1 Understanding Object Oriented Programming</h3>

<p>But just what is an object?
</p>
<p>At its simplest, an object has two components:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Internal state.</strong> This is embodied by variable(s)
   known only by the object. A variable only visible within the object
   is called a <em>private</em> variable. As a consequence, it is impossible
   &ndash; if the object decides so &ndash; to know the internal state of the object
   from another object.

</li><li> <strong>A repertoire of behaviors.</strong> These are the message(s)
   an object instance responds to. When the object
   receives a message it understands, it gets its behavior from a
   method with that name known by its class or superclass.

</li></ul>

<span id="index-class-7"></span>
<span id="index-subclass"></span>
<span id="index-instance-1"></span>
<span id="index-selector"></span>
<p>The method name is called a <em>selector</em> because it is used to select
which behavior is invoked. For example, in <code>'hello' at: 1 put: $B</code>,
the method invoked has the selector <code>#at:put:</code> and the arguments
<code>1</code> and <code>$B</code>.  All selectors are symbols.
</p>
<p>Object instances are created &ndash; <em>instantiated</em> &ndash;
following a model or template. This model is known as its <em>Class</em>.
All instances of a class share the same methods and so react in the same ways.
</p>
<p>For example, there is one class <code>Fraction</code> but many
fractions (1/2, 1/3, 23/17, ...) which all behave the way
we expect fractions to behave.  The class <code>Fraction</code>
and the classes it inherits from define this common behavior,
as we will now describe.
</p>

<span id="index-variable-1"></span>
<span id="index-instance-variable"></span>
<p>A given class declares its internal variables &ndash; states &ndash; and the
behavior by implementing the methods.  A variable is basically a named
box which can hold any object.  Each instance variable of a class gets its own
box with the common name.
</p>
<span id="index-number-19"></span>
<p>Lets see how the <code>Fraction</code> class is declared:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Number subclass: #Fraction
   instanceVariableNames: 'numerator denominator'
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Kernel-Numbers'
</pre></div>

<p>As expected there are two variables &ndash; named <em>instance variables</em>
&ndash; to define the <code>numerator</code> and <code>denominator</code> of
a fraction.  Each instance of fraction has its own numerator and its
own denominator.
</p>
<span id="index-superclass"></span>
<p>From this declaration, we observe there is a hierarchy in
the class definition: <code>Fraction</code> is a kind of
<code>Number</code>. This means a fraction inherits the internal state
(variables) and behavior (methods) defined in the <code>Number</code>
class. <code>Fraction</code> is called a <em>subclass</em> of <code>Number</code>,
and so naturally we call <code>Number</code> a <em>superclass</em> of <code>Fraction</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-class-8"></span>
<p>A Class specifies the behavior of all of its instances.  It is useful
to be able to say <em>this object is like that object, but with these
differences</em>.  We do this in Smalltalk by having classes inherit instance
state and behavior from their parent Class.  This child, or subclass
then specifies just the instance state and behavior that is different
from its parent, retaining all the unmodified behaviours.
</p>
<p>This aspect of object oriented programming is called
<em>inheritance</em>. In Cuis-Smalltalk, each class inherits from one parent
class.
</p>
<span id="index-polymorphism"></span>

<p>In Smalltalk, we say that each object decides for itself how it
reponds to a message.  This is called <em>polymorphism</em>.  The same
message selector may be sent to objects of different Classes.  The
<em>shape</em> (morph) of the computation is different depending on the
specific class of the <em>many</em> (poly) possible classes of the
object receiving the message.
</p>
<p>Different kinds of objects respond to the same <code>#printString</code>
message in different, but appropriate ways.
</p>
<span id="index-instance-2"></span>
<span id="index-class-9"></span>
<span id="index-method-3"></span>
<p>We have already met fractions. Those fractions are objects called
<em>instance</em>s of the class <code>Fraction</code>. To create an instance
we wrote <code>5 / 4</code>, the mechanism is based on message sending
and polymorphism.  Let us look into how this works.
</p>
<p>The number <code>5</code> is an integer receiving the message <code>#/</code>,
therefore looking at the method <code>/</code> in the <code>Integer</code>
class we can see how the fraction is instatiated. See part of this
method:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/ aNumber
&quot;Refer to the comment in Number / &quot;
| quoRem |
aNumber isInteger ifTrue:
../..
   ifFalse: [^ (Fraction numerator: self denominator: aNumber) reduced]].
../..
</pre></div>

<p>From this source code, we learn that in some situations, the method
returns a fraction, reduced. We can expect that in some other
situation an integer is returned, for example <code>6 / 2</code>.
</p>
<p>In the example, we observe the message <code>#numerator:denominator:</code> is
sent to the class <code>Fraction</code>, such a message refers to a
<em>class method</em> understood only by the <code>Fraction</code> class. It
is expected such a named method returns an instance of a
<code>Fraction</code>.
</p>
<p>Try this out in a workspace:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">Fraction numerator: 24 denominator: 21
&rArr; 24/21
</pre></div>

<p>Observe how the resulting fraction is not reduced. Whereas it is reduced
when instantiated with the <code>#/</code> message:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">24 / 21
&rArr; 8/7
</pre></div>

<p>A class method is often used to create a new instance from a class. In
<a href="Fun-with-collections.html#forLoop">Example 4.7</a>, the message <code>#new</code> is sent to the class
<code>OrderedCollection</code> to create a new empty collection;
<em><code>new</code></em> is a class method.
</p>
<p>In <a href="Fun-with-collections.html#repeatLoop">Example 4.8</a>, the <code>#newFrom:</code> message is sent to the class
<code>OrderedCollection</code> to create a new collection filled with
elements from the array given in argument; <em><code>newFrom:</code></em> is
another class method.
</p>
<span id="index-instance-3"></span>
<span id="index-method-4"></span>
<span id="index-polymorphism-1"></span>
<p>Now observe the hierarchy of the Number class:
</p>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><code>Number</code>
   <code>Float</code>
      <code>BoxedFloat64</code>
      <code>SmallFloat64</code>
   <code>Fraction</code>
   <code>Integer</code>
      <code>LargePositiveInteger</code>
         <code>LargeNegativeInteger</code>
      <code>SmallInteger</code>
</pre></div>

<span id="index-number-20"></span>
<p><code>Float</code>, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Fraction</code> are direct
descendants of the <code>Number</code> class. We have already learned about the
<code>#squared</code> message sent to integer and fraction instances:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">16 squared &rArr; 256
(2 / 3) squared &rArr; 4/9
</pre></div>

<p>As the <code>#squared</code> message is sent to <code>Integer</code> and
<code>Fraction</code> instances, the associated <code>squared</code> method is
called an <em>instance method</em>. This method is defined in both the
<code>Number</code> and <code>Fraction</code> classes.
</p>
<span id="index-method-5"></span>
<span id="index-returned-value-1"></span>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine this method in <code>Number</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">Number&gt;&gt;squared
&quot;Answer the receiver multiplied by itself.&quot;
   ^ self * self
</pre></div>

<p>In an instance method source code, <code>self</code> refers to the
object itself, here it is the value of the number. The &#x2191; (also
<code>^</code>) symbol indicates to <em>return</em> the following value
<code>self * self</code>.  One might pronounce ^ as &ldquo;return&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s examine this same method in <code>Fraction</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">Fraction&gt;&gt;squared
   ^ Fraction
      numerator: numerator squared
      denominator: denominator squared
</pre></div>

<p>Here a new fraction is instantiated with the original instance
numerator and denominator being squared.
This alternate <code>squared</code> method, ensures a fraction instance is
returned.
</p>
<span id="index-method-6"></span>
<span id="index-overriding"></span>
<p>When the message <code>#squared</code> is sent to a number, different methods are
executed depending on if the number is a fraction or another kind of
number. Polymorphism means that the Class of each instance decides
how it will repond to a particular message.
Here, the <code>Fraction</code> class
is <em>overriding</em> the <code>squared</code> method, defined above in the
class hierarchy.  If a method is not overridden, an inherited method
is invoked to respond to the message.
</p>
<span id="index-number-21"></span>
<p>Still in the <code>Number</code> hierarchy, let&rsquo;s examine another example
of polymorphism with the <code>#abs</code> message:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">-10 abs &rArr; 10
5.3 abs &rArr; 5.3
(-5 / 3) abs &rArr; 5/3
</pre></div>

<p>The implementation in <code>Number</code> does not need much
explanation. There is the <code>#ifTrue:ifFalse:</code> we have not yet
discussed so far, but the code is quite self-explanatory:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Number&gt;&gt;abs
&quot;Answer a Number that is the absolute value (positive magnitude) of the 
receiver.&quot;
   self &lt; 0
      ifTrue: [^ self negated]
      ifFalse: [^ self]
</pre></div>

<p>This implementation will do just fine for the <code>Number</code>
subclasses. Nevertheless, there are several classes overriding it for
specialized or optimized cases.
</p>
<span id="index-method-7"></span>
<p>For example, regarding large positive integer, <code>abs</code> is
empty. Indeed, <strong>in the absence of explicitly returned value, the
default returned value is the instance itself</strong>, in our situation the
<code>LargePositiveInteger</code> instance:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">LargePositiveInteger&gt;&gt;abs
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>LargeNegativeInteger</code> knows it is negative and its absolute
value is itself but with its sign reversed, that is <code>negated</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">LargeNegativeInteger&gt;&gt;abs
   ^ self negated
</pre></div>
   
<p>These two overriding methods are more efficient as they avoid unnecessary
checks and ifTrue/ifFalse branches. Polymorphism is often used to avoid
unnecessary checks and code branches.
</p>
<span id="index-keyboard-shortcut-6"></span>

<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="note.png" alt="note">
If you select the text <code>abs</code> in a Browser or
Workspace and right-click to get the context menu, you will find an
entry <code>Implementors of it</code>.  You can select this or use
<kbd>Ctrl-m</kbd> (<em>i<b>M</b>plementors</em>) to see how various methods for
<code>#abs</code> use polymorphism to specialize their answer to
produce the naturally expected result.
</p></blockquote>

<p>As an object instance is modeled by its class, it is possible to
ask any object its
class with the <code>#class</code> message. Observe carefully the class
returned in line 2 and 3:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="askingClass"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">1 class &rArr; SmallInteger 
(1/3) class &rArr; Fraction 
(6/2) class &rArr; SmallInteger 
(1/3) asFloat class  &rArr; SmallFloat64 
(1.0/3) class &rArr; SmallFloat64 
'Hello' class &rArr; String 
('Hello' at: 1) class &rArr; Character
</pre></div>
