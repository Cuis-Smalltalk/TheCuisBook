<span id="Spacewar_0021-Events-1"></span><h3 class="section">8.3 Spacewar! Events</h3>
<p>Obviously our Spacewar! game handles events. Firstly we want to control the
ships with the keyboard. Secondly, we want the game to pause
when the mouse cursor moves out of the game play, and resume when it
enters again.
</p>
<p>In our design, a unique morph, <code>SpaceWar</code> instance, models the
game play. Therefore we want this instance to handle the events
described above.
</p>
<span id="Mouse-event"></span><h4 class="subsection">8.3.1 Mouse event</h4>
<span id="index-event-5"></span>
<span id="index-mouse"></span>

<span id="Mouse-cursor-enters-game-play"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Mouse cursor enters game play</h4>
<span id="index-event-6"></span>

<p>We want to catch events when the mouse cursor moves over our
<code>SpaceWar</code> morph.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="handleMouseOver"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>Which method should return true to let the game play be notified
with a dedicated messages that the mouse cursor enters or leaves? In which
class should we implement this method?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 8.1: </strong>Get notified of mouse move-over event</p></div></div>
<p>Once we make explicit we want the game play to receive mouse move-over
events, we need to set the behavior accordingly with dedicated
methods.
</p>
<span id="index-event-7"></span>
<p>Each time the mouse cursor enters the game play, we want to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Get keyboard focus.</strong> It follows the mouse cursor: the
  keyboard input goes to the morph under the mouse cursor. In Cuis-Smalltalk,
  the mouse cursor is modeled as a <code>HandMorph</code> instance, an
  event object (see event classes hierarchy at the beginning of this
  chapter). An event object is interrogated about its hand with the
  <code>#hand</code> message. All in all, we want the keyboard focus to be
  targeted toward our game play when the mouse enters:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">event hand newKeyboardFocus: self
</pre></div>

</li><li> <strong>Resume the game.</strong> The continuous update of the game is
  done through a dedicated process stepping mechanism, which will
  be discussed in the next chapter. The game play just asks itself to
  resume stepping:
  <div class="example">
<pre class="example">self startStepping
</pre></div>
</li></ul>

<div class="float"><span id="mouseEnter"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>Which message is
sent to the game play to be notified the mouse cursor enters the game
play area?  How should the matching method be written?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 8.2: </strong>Handle mouse enter event</p></div></div>
<span id="Mouse-cursor-leaves-game-play"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Mouse cursor leaves game play</h4>
<span id="index-event-8"></span>

<p>We also want to be informed when the mouse cursor leaves our
<code>SpaceWar</code> morph. Thanks to the work done in
<a href="#handleMouseOver">Exercise 8.1</a>, we already informed Cuis-Smalltalk we want to be
notified of mouse movement over the game play. However we need to code
the behavior when the mouse cursor leaves the game play:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Release keyboard focus.</strong> We tell Cuis-Smalltalk the game play
  does not want keyboard focus:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">event hand releaseKeyboardFocus: self
</pre></div>

</li><li> <strong>Pause the game.</strong> We stop the continuous
  <em>stepping</em> update of the game:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">self stopStepping
</pre></div>

</li></ul>

<div class="float"><span id="mouseLeave"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>Which message is
sent to the game play to be notified the mouse cursor leaves the game
play area?  How should we write the overridden method?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 8.3: </strong>Handle mouse leave event</p></div></div>
<p>In graphic user interface, a visual effect is often used to inform the
user the keyboard focus changed. In Spacewar! we change the game play
background depending on the sate of the keyboard focus.
</p>
<p>In <a href="#ch08_002dFocus">Figure 8.1</a>, at the left keyboard focus is on the game; at the
right keyboard focus is not on the game, it is paused and we can see
underneath.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="ch08_002dFocus"></span>
<div align="center"><img src="ch08-Focus.png" alt="ch08-Focus">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 8.1: </strong>Spacewar! effect depending on the keyboard focus</p></div></div>
<p>In the Morph framework, the <code>#keyboardFocusChange:</code> message is sent
to the morph losing or gaining the keyboard focus, its parameter is a
Boolean. Therefore we implement the <a href="#ch08_002dFocus">Figure 8.1</a> behavior in the
matching <code>SpaceWar</code>&rsquo;s method <code>keyboardFocusChange:</code>
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="keyboardFocusEffect"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">SpaceWar&gt;&gt;keyboardFocusChange: gotFocus
   gotFocus 
      ifTrue: [color := self defaultColor]
      ifFalse: [color := self defaultColor alpha: 0.5].
   self redrawNeeded
</pre></div>

<span id="Keyboard-event"></span><h4 class="subsection">8.3.2 Keyboard event</h4>
<span id="index-event-9"></span>
<span id="index-event-10"></span>

<p>To control the space ships, we use the keyboard. Therefore we want the
game play to be notified of keyboard events.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="keyboardEvent"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>Find
out which method should return true to let the game be notified of
keyboard event.</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 8.4: </strong>Get notified of keyboard event</p></div></div>
<span id="index-event-11"></span>
<p>We can decide to be notified of the key down or key up event and also
key down then up event (<em>key stroke</em>). As long as our
<code>SpaceWar</code> morph responds true to the <code>#handlesKeyboard</code>
message, it receives the messages <code>#keyUp:</code>, <code>#keyDown:</code> and
<code>#keyStroke:</code>. By default, the matching methods in the
<code>Morph</code> class do nothing.
</p>
<p>The argument of these messages is a <code>KeyboardEvent</code> object to
which, among other things, you can ask the <code>#keyCharacter</code> of the
pressed key. The first player ship &ndash; the green one &ndash; is controlled
with the keyboard arrows when there are stroked:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="firstShipControl"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">SpaceWar&gt;&gt;keyStroke: event
   | key |
   key := event keyCharacter.
   key = Character arrowUp ifTrue: [^ ships first push].
   key = Character arrowRight ifTrue: [^ ships first right].
   key = Character arrowLeft ifTrue: [^ ships first left].
   key = Character arrowDown ifTrue: [^ ships first fireTorpedo].
</pre></div>

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Example 8.2: </strong>Keystroke to control the first player ship</p></div></div>
<p>The <code>arrowUp</code>, <code>arrowRight</code>,.... are <code>Character</code>
class methods returning character codes representing the
arrow keys.
</p>
<p>To control the second player ship, we use another classic arrangement
in QWERTY keyboard controlled game:
WASD<a id="DOCF27" href="#FOOT27"><sup>27</sup></a>.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="secondShipControl"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>Append the additional code to <a href="#firstShipControl">Example 8.2</a> to control
the second player ship with the keys WASD. As a reminder, in Smalltalk
the character code for q can be written as <code>$q</code>.</em>
</p></blockquote>
