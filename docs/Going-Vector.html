<p>For Cuis-Smalltalk, we built Morphic 3, the third design iteration of these
ideas, after Self&rsquo;s Morphic 1 and Squeak&rsquo;s Morphic 2. If you already
know Morphic in Self or Squeak, most concepts are similar, although
with some improvements: Morphic 3 coordinates are not limited to being
integer numbers, the apparent size (zoom level) of elements is not
tied to pixel density, and all drawing is done with high quality
(subpixel) anti aliasing. These enhancements are enabled by the huge
advance in hardware resources since Self and Squeak were designed (in
the late 80&rsquo;s and late 90&rsquo;s respectively). Additionally, careful
design of the framework relieves Morph programmers from much the
complexity that was required, especially with regards to geometry.
</p>
<p>This step is required until VectorGraphics becomes part of the base
Cuis-Smalltalk image:
</p>
<span id="index-morph-7"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Feature require: 'VectorGraphics'
</pre></div>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TrueTypeFontFamily read: DirectoryEntry smalltalkImageDirectory
   / 'TrueTypeFonts' / 'DejaVu'/ 'DejaVuSans'
</pre></div>

<span id="A-first-example"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.1.1 A first example</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some examples. What we want is to build our own
graphic objects, or Morphs. A Morph class is part of the Morph
hierarchy and usually includes a <code>drawOn:</code> method for drawing
its distinctive appearance. If we forget about computers for a second,
and consider drawing with color pens on a sheet of paper, one of the
most basic things we can do is to draw straight lines.
</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s start a System Browser window and build a straight line
object:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Morph subclass: #LineExampleMorph
   instanceVariableNames: ''
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Morphic-Learning'
</pre></div>

<p>In method category <code>drawing</code> add:
</p>
<span id="index-morph-8"></span>
<span id="index-morph-9"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">LineExampleMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas strokeWidth: 20 color: Color green do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: 100 y: 100;
         lineToX: 400 y: 200 ].
</pre></div>

<p>Now in a Workspace execute:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">LineExampleMorph new openInWorld
</pre></div>

<p>If you get a prompter asking whether to install and activate Vector
Graphics support, please answer yes. There it is. You have already
built your first <code>Morph</code> class.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="ch07_002d01_002dLineDetails"></span>
<div align="center"><img src="ch07-01-LineDetails.png" alt="ch07-01-LineDetails">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.1: </strong>Details of our line morph</p></div></div>
<p>The code is self evident, the <code>drawOn:</code> method takes a
<code>VectorCanvas</code> instance as an argument. <code>VectorCanvas</code>
provides many drawing operations for morphs to use. You can play with
the various drawing operations and their parameters, and see the
result. If you make a mistake, and the <code>drawOn:</code> method fails,
you&rsquo;ll get a red and yellow error box. After fixing your
<code>drawOn:</code> method, do ...World menu &rarr;
<code>Debug...</code> &rarr; <code>Start drawing all again</code>.. to get
your morph redrawn correctly.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="exeCrossMorph"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>How will you modify our
line morph so it draws itself as a cross with an extent of 200
pixels?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 7.1: </strong>Cross morph</p></div></div>

<span id="Morph-you-can-move"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.1.2 Morph you can move</h4>
<span id="index-morph-10"></span>
<p>You might have already tried to click and drag on your Line, like you
can do with regular windows and most other Morphs. If not, try
now. But nothing happens! The reason is that our Morph is fixed in a
place in the owner morph (the WorldMorph). It is fixed because
<code>drawOn:</code> says it should be a line between <code>100@100</code>
and <code>400@200</code>. Moving it around would mean modifying those
points. One possible way to do that could be to store those points in instance
variables.
</p>
<p>But now, we just want to code our morph in the simplest possible way,
and still be able to move it around. The solution is to make it
subclass of <code>MovableMorph</code>, instead of <code>Morph</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-morph-11"></span>
<p>To do this, first evaluate the code below to get rid of all LineExampleMorph instances:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="deleteMorphInstances"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">LineExampleMorph allInstancesDo: [ :m | m delete]
</pre></div>

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Example 7.1: </strong>Delete all instances of a given morph</p></div></div>
<p>Then, in the System Browser class declaration for LineExampleMorph, type
<code>MovableMorph</code> instead of <code>Morph</code> and save. Now execute
again:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">LineExampleMorph new openInWorld
</pre></div>

<span id="index-morph-12"></span>
<p>You will get a line you can grab with the mouse and move it
around. <code>MovableMorph</code> adds a new instance variable called
<code>location</code>. If a morph has a <code>location</code>, it can be
moved around, by modifying it. The <code>location</code> also defines a
new local coordinate system. All the coordinates used in the
<code>drawOn:</code> method are now relative to this new coordinate
system. That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t need to modify the <code>drawOn:</code>
method. <code>drawOn:</code> now tells how the morph should be drawn, but
not where. The <code>location</code> also specifies a possible rotation
and scale factor. This means that subinstances of <code>MovableMorph</code>
can also be rotated and zoomed.
</p>

<span id="Filled-morph"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.1.3 Filled morph</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build another morph, to have more fun.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">MovableMorph subclass: #TriangleExampleMorph
   instanceVariableNames: 'borderColor fillColor'
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Morphic-Learning'
</pre></div>

<p>In method category <code>initialization</code> add:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;initialize
   super initialize.
   borderColor := Color random alpha: 0.8.
   fillColor := Color random alpha: 0.6.
</pre></div>

<p>In the <code>drawing</code> method category add:
</p>
<span id="index-morph-13"></span>
<span id="index-morph-14"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas strokeWidth: 10 color: borderColor fillColor: fillColor do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: 0 y: 100;
         lineToX: 87 y: -50;
         lineToX: -87 y: -50;
         lineToX: 0 y: 100 ].
</pre></div>

<p>Take a moment to understand that code, to guess what it will do. Now
execute:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph new openInWorld
</pre></div>

<p>Do it several times, and move each triangle around. Each new triangle
you create has different colors. And these colors are not completely
opaque. This means that when you place your triangle over some other
morph, you can see through it.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="ch07_002d02_002dTriangles"></span>
<div align="center"><img src="ch07-02-Triangles.png" alt="ch07-02-Triangles">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.2: </strong>A variety of triangle morphs, one decorated with its halo and coordinates system</p></div></div>

<div class="float"><span id="exeRectMorph"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>How will you write a
movable rectangle morph with an x,y extent of 200 by 100? The rect will
be filled with a random translucent color and surrounded by a thin
blue line.</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 7.2: </strong>Rectangle morph</p></div></div>
<p>As we learnt previously, Morphic gives you additional ways to interact
with your morphs. With a three button mouse or a wheel mouse, place
the mouse pointer (a <code>HandMorph</code> instance) over one of your
triangles and click with the center button or mouse wheel. If you don&rsquo;t have
a three button mouse substitute <kbd>Command-click</kbd>. You get a constellation
of small colored circles around your morph. This is called the morph&rsquo;s
<em>halo</em>, and each colored circle is a <em>halo
handle</em>. See <a href="#ch07_002d02_002dTriangles">Figure 7.2</a>.
</p>
<p>At the top left you have the red <code>Remove</code> handle. Clicking on it
just removes the morph from the morphic world. Hover your hand over
each handle, and you&rsquo;ll get a tooltip with its name. Other handles let
you <code>Duplicate</code> a morph, open a <code>Menu</code> with actions on it,
<code>Pick up</code> (same as dragging it with the the mouse as you did
before). The <code>Move</code> operation is similar to <code>Pick up</code>, but
doesn&rsquo;t remove the morph from the current owner. More about that,
later. The <code>Debug</code> handle opens a menu from where you can open
an Inspector or a Hierarchy Browser to study the morph.
</p>
<p>You also have a <code>Rotate</code> and <code>Change scale</code> handles. Try
them! To use them, move your hand to the handle, and then press the
mouse button and drag it. As you might have guessed, the rotate
handles spins your morph around its <code>0@0</code> coordinates
(i.e. the origin of its own coordinate system). The scale handles
controls the apparent zoom applied to your morph. Both scale and
rotation (and also displacement, as when you move your morph around)
are implemented by modifying the inner coordinate system defined by
your morph. Displacement, rotation and scale are floating point
numbers, and thus not limited to integers.
</p>
<p>We will learn how to control all this with code and animate our morph.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="exeRotateRect"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>Rotate your rectangle morph. Does it rotate around its center or
around one corner? If necessary rewrite your rectangle morph so it rotates
around its center.</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 7.3: </strong>Rotate your rectangle morph arround its center</p></div></div>
<p>In the solution we gave for the <a href="#exeCrossMorph">Exercise 7.1</a> (<a href="Solutions-of-the-Exercises.html">Solutions of the Exercises</a>), the cross origin is set to its top left. Therefore it
rotates around this point.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="exeCrossCenterMorph"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>How will you rewrite the <code>drawOn:</code> so it rotates around

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 7.4: </strong>Rotate the cross around its center</p></div></div>
<span id="Animated-morph"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.1.4 Animated morph</h4>
<span id="index-morph-15"></span>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add two methods to our <code>TriangleExampleMorph</code> to
make our triangle <em>alive</em>:
</p>
<span id="index-morph-16"></span>
<p>In the method category <code>stepping</code> define:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;wantsSteps
   ^ true
</pre></div>

<p>...and:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;step
   fillColor := Color random.
   self redrawNeeded
</pre></div>

<p>Then create some additional triangles as you did before.
</p>
<p>This will make our triangles change color once a second. But more
interesting, edit the method:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;stepTime
   ^ 100
</pre></div>

<p>...and:
</p>
<span id="index-morph-17"></span>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;step
   self morphPosition: self morphPosition + (0.4@0).
   self redrawNeeded
</pre></div>

<p>Now, our morph steps ten times per second, and moves to the right at a
speed of four pixels per second. At each step it moves by 0.4 pixels,
and not by an integer number of pixels. High quality anti-aliasing
drawing means we can actually do that! You can make it step at a speed
of four times a second, and move 1 pixel each time, and see how different
that looks.
</p>
<p>Now try this:
</p>
<span id="index-morph-18"></span>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;step
   self morphPosition: self morphPosition + (0.2@0).
   self rotateBy: 4 degreesToRadians.
   self redrawNeeded
</pre></div>

<p>It gets even better. First get rid of all instances:
</p> 
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph allInstancesDo: [ :m | m delete]
</pre></div>

<p>And modify these methods:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;initialize
   super initialize.
   borderColor := Color random alpha: 0.8.
   fillColor := Color random alpha: 0.6.
   scaleBy := 1.1
</pre></div>

<p>Accept <code>scaleBy</code> as a new instance variable of the
<code>TriangleExampleMorph</code> class.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph&gt;&gt;step
   self morphPosition: self morphPosition + (0.2@0).
   self rotateBy: 4 degreesToRadians.
   self scaleBy: scaleBy.
   self scale &gt; 1.2 ifTrue: [scaleBy := 0.9].
   self scale &lt; 0.2 ifTrue: [scaleBy := 1.1].
   self redrawNeeded
</pre></div>

<p>Then create a new triangle:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">TriangleExampleMorph new openInWorld
</pre></div>

<p>See that when the triangle is doing its crazy dance, you can still
open a halo and interact with it.
</p>

<div class="float"><span id="ch07_002d03_002dAnimatedMorph"></span>
<div align="center"><img src="ch07-03-AnimatedMorph.gif" alt="ch07-03-AnimatedMorph">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.3: </strong>Animated morph</p></div></div>

<span id="Morph-in-morph"></span><h4 class="subsection">7.1.5 Morph in morph</h4>
<span id="index-morph-19"></span>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s try something different. Grab one of your
<code>LineExampleMorph</code>. With the halo, zoom it until it is about the
size of your triangle. Now place the triangle above your line. Open a
halo on the triangle, click on the <code>Menu</code> handle and select
...<code>embed into</code> &rarr;
<code>LineExampleMorph</code>. This makes the triangle a submorph of the
line. Now, if you move, scale or rotate the line, the triangle also
gets adjusted.
</p>
<p>You can open a halo on the triangle. To do this, middle-click twice
over it. With the halo on the triangle, you can rotate or zoom it
independently of the line. Also note that when you grab the triangle
with your hand (not using the halo), you grab the
line&nbsp;+&nbsp;triangle composite. You can&rsquo;t just drag the triangle
away. For this, you need the triangle&rsquo;s halo. Use its <code>Move</code>
handle<a id="DOCF21" href="#FOOT21"><sup>21</sup></a> to position it without <em>getting it out</em> of the line. Use
its <code>Pick up</code> handle to take it with the hand and drop
it in the world. Now, the triangle is no a longer submorph of the line,
and the morphs can be moved, rotated or scaled independently.
</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s try something. Make the triangle submorph of the line
again. Now add the following method to category <code>geometry
testing</code> of the class <code>LineExampleMorph</code>:
</p>
<span id="index-morph-20"></span>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">LineExampleMorph&gt;&gt;clipsSubmorphs
   ^ true
</pre></div>

<p>The drawing of the triangle gets cut exactly at the bounds of the
line. This is most useful for implementing scrolling panes that only
make a part of their contents visible, but might have other uses too.

a bit!</p>
