<p>As we noted above, Cuis-Smalltalk is a pure object-oriented environment. This 
means that every single entitiy you are dealing with is represented
as an instance of a class written in Cuis-Smalltalk itself. As a direct
consequence, Cuis-Smalltalk is mostly written in itself.  This means
the entire system is open to you to learn and play with.
</p>
<p>What we call system classes are models of fundamental objects. In
other programming languages, these would be implemented in
that language&rsquo;s standard library.
</p>
<p>In a truly open system, there is no real distinction between system
classes and user classes, but it will help us to draw a boundary
around the most used objects. Let&rsquo;s have a brief introduction to some
fundamental Smalltalk classes and their most important methods.
</p>
<p>In the upper left pane of the Browser, Categories of classes important
to start with are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Kernel-Numbers</strong>. Related to the different number
   representations and calculations, including mathematics functions,
   conversion, intervals and even iterations.
   
</li><li> <strong>Kernel-Text</strong>. Related to character and string as
   collection of characters.

</li><li> <p><strong>Collections-Abstract</strong>, <strong>Collections-Unordered</strong>,
   <strong>Collections-Sequenceable</strong>, <strong>Collections-Arrayed</strong>.
   Related to Array, Dictionary, Set, OrderedCollection and many more.
   This category includes common accessing, enumeration, mathematical
   functions, and sorting.
</p>
</li></ul>
