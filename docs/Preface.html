<p>A language that doesn&rsquo;t affect the way you think about programming, is
not worth knowing.

<p>Cuis-Smalltalk &mdash;in short, Cuis&mdash; is a portable environment for doing,
building and sharing software. Like any other tool, Cuis doesn&rsquo;t
require having a particular mindset or following a particular
process. However, Cuis is built with a specific view on what software
is, and what it means to build software. As a consequence, Cuis is
especially effective if these ideas resonate with you and, at least
occasionally, you let them guide your thoughts and actions.
</p>
<p>In this book, we will go along with you as you explore, discover and
learn about Cuis and Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t assume knowledge of computer programming, but if you happen
to have some experience with an Object Oriented or Functional language
you will recognize many concepts. If you don&rsquo;t have any programming
experience, or you have coded in an imperative, closer to the metal
language, such as C or Assembly, many of the ideas may be new.
</p>
<p>In any case, especially during the first chapters, read this book and
follow the examples with an open mind. A new point of view on what
software development means will be an enriching experience.  For us,
programming is a thoughtful process.
</p>
<p>We understand software development as the activity of learning and
documenting knowledge for ourselves and others to use, and also to be
run on a computer. The fact that a computer can execute the software
and produce useful solutions to some problem, is a consequence of the
knowledge being sound and relevant. Just making it work is not the
important part!
</p>
<p>These ideas, that will be developed further along in the book you are
reading, strongly shape Cuis and the experience of using it.  Amongst
their most obvious consequences are a passion for reducing unneeded
complexity, while providing a complete, live software development
experience.
</p>
<p>This book is an introduction and invitation to explore Cuis.  We hope
you will join us in this journey to use Cuis as a medium to express
ideas and thoughts, to build cool stuff, and to make Cuis ever better.

<p>To make your journey with this book more enjoyable, the
<em>Spacewar!</em><a id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>
project is its recurring theme. It is distilled along the book in code
examples, exercises and dedicated chapters. At the end of the book,
you will have written a replica of this historic video game.
