<p>Cuis-Smalltalk &mdash;in short, Cuis&mdash; is a portable environment for doing,
building and sharing software. Like any other tool, Cuis doesn&rsquo;t
require having a particular mindset or following a particular
process. However, Cuis is built with a specific view on what software
is, and what it means to build software. As a consequence, Cuis is
especially effective if these ideas resonate with you and, at least
occasionally, you let them guide your thoughts and actions.
</p>
<p>In this book, we will accompany you as you explore, discover and
learn about Cuis and Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t assume knowledge of computer programming, but if you happen
to have some experience with an Object-Oriented or Functional language
you will recognize many concepts. If you don&rsquo;t have any programming
experience or you have coded in an imperative, closer to the metal
language, such as C or Assembly, many of the ideas may be new.
</p>
<p>In any case, especially during the first chapters, read this book and
follow the examples with an open mind. A new point of view on what
software development means will be an enriching experience.  For us,
programming is a thoughtful process.
</p>
<p>We understand software development as the activity of learning and
documenting knowledge for ourselves and others to use, and also to be
run on a computer. The fact that a computer can execute the software
and produce useful solutions to some problem is a consequence of the
knowledge being sound and relevant. Just making it work is not the
important part!
</p>
<p>These ideas strongly shape Cuis and the experience of using it, and
we&rsquo;ll develop them further along in this book.  Amongst their most
obvious consequences are a passion for reducing unneeded complexity,
while providing a complete, live software development experience.
</p>
<p>This book is an introduction and invitation to explore Cuis.  We hope
you will join us in this journey to use it as a medium to express
ideas and thoughts, to build cool stuff, and to make Cuis even better.

<p>To make your journey with this book more enjoyable, the
<em class="emph">Spacewar!</em><a class="footnote" id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>
project is its recurring theme. It is distilled into the book in code
examples, exercises and dedicated chapters. At the end of the book,
you will have written a replica of this historic video game. The final
Cuis-Smalltalk package of this game can be downloaded from the book
repository<a class="footnote" id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="How-to-use-the-book">How to use the book</h3>

<p>The reader can study Cuis-Smalltalk from two versions of the book:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><strong class="strong">Online.</strong> With a web browser at the
 <a class="url" href="https://cuis-smalltalk.github.io/TheCuisBook">https://cuis-smalltalk.github.io/TheCuisBook</a> address. The book
 is structured in chapters and sections, displayed one at a time. It
 is a very flexible way to study the book: you can open several
 chapters and appendices on different tabs in your web browser. It
 requires you to be connected to the Internet, though.

</li><li><strong class="strong">Offline.</strong> In a single PDF file you download and read
 offline. It can be printed as a nice paper book. The most recent
 build can be found at <a class="url" href="https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook">https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook</a>.

</li></ul>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-returned-value"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-variable"></a>

<p>The chapters come with many examples. Some can be copied and pasted into
Cuis-Smalltalk. We encourage you to do this, and in the process modify them
to explore on your own.
</p>
<p>The code examples in the online version can be directly copied and
pasted into Cuis-Smalltalk. This is why the assignment character &ldquo;&#x2190;&rdquo;
you see in the developer Cuis-Smalltalk window is printed as &ldquo;:=&rdquo; in the
online version of the book. The same applies with the return character
&ldquo;&#x2191;&rdquo; printed as &ldquo;^&rdquo; in the online version.
</p>
<p>In the offline PDF version, the code examples are printed with the same
assignment and return characters as seen in the Cuis-Smalltalk windows. Copying
and pasting also work as expected.
</p>
<p>Other examples are code extracts which are not self sufficient to be
executed as is. Their purpose is to expose specific facets of the Smalltalk
language.
</p>
<p>A typical example without a caption looks like:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">100 factorial
</pre></div>

<p>The same example with a caption appears with a number and title, and
can be used as a reference elsewhere in the book:
</p>
<div class="float" id="exampleExample">
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">100 factorial
&rArr;  9332621544394415268169923885626670049071596826438162146859

51185210916864000000000000000000000000
</pre></div>

<div class="caption"><p><strong class="strong">Example 1: </strong>I am an example with a caption and a result</p></div></div>
<p>There are also a lot of exercises. Most are very easy; they intend to give you
an opportunity to apply what you have just learned.
</p>
<p>Exercises are easily identified by the Cuis-Smalltalk mascot: <em class="dfn">Cuis</em>,
a South American rodent!
