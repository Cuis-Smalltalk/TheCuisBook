<p>Cuis-Smalltalk is an environment and a programming language executed on a
virtual computer. It is based on two major components:
the Smalltalk <em>virtual machine</em> conceptualizing this virtual
computer and an <em>image</em> representing the state of this computer.
</p>
<p>The virtual machine is an executable program running on a dedicated
host (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, etc.). It is called the <em>Open
Smalltalk Virtual Machine</em>, or Squeak <acronym>VM</acronym> in short. There are
different flavors of <acronym>VM</acronym>, one for each combination of Operating
System and CPU architecture. Therefore, one <acronym>VM</acronym> compiled
for Windows in Intel architecture will not work on Linux in
ARM architecture. You need the specific <acronym>VM</acronym> compiled for
the combination of Operating System and CPU architecture
your computer is based on.
</p>
<p>The image is a regular file feeding the <acronym>VM</acronym> with all the objects
 defining the state of the virtual computer. These objects are
 classes, methods, instances of those classes as numbers, strings,
 windows, debuggers &ndash; whatever existed when the state of the virtual
 computer was saved. An image file saved on a given Operating System
 and CPU architecture run identically on another system as
 long as the same <acronym>VM</acronym> version is used.
</p>
<p>What makes Cuis-Smalltalk special is the living entities in the image: its
class population and arrangement, how the classes inherit from each
other. The Cuis-Smalltalk moto is to be a tiny, coherent and human
understandable Smalltalk environment; its class count is typically
less than 600.
</p>
<p>To get you started easily, we provide three
archives<a id="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>
for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows on Intel architecture. These
archives come with the dedicated <acronym>VM</acronym> and the image of Cuis-Smalltalk
5.0#4253. Into this image we pre-installed a few packages
to make your life easier when you experience the examples and
exercises of the book. At the reading time of this book, Cuis-Smalltalk has
likely evolved with a more recent version, nevertheless your learning
is transferable to more recent version of Cuis-Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>To get Cuis-Smalltalk running on your computer, follow the instructions in
the <samp>README</samp> file accompanying the archive. Once you get Cuis-Smalltalk
running, read the information displayed on the windows. When you are
done, close these windows, next you will adjust Cuis-Smalltalk to your
preferences.
</p>
<span id="Editing-your-preferences"></span><h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 Editing your preferences</h4>
<p>Once you read the instructions on the default windows, the next 
thing you want to do is to adjust its visual properties to fit your
preferences and needs. To do so, access the World menu
...Background click &rarr; Preferences... then
select the pin on the top right of the menu to make it permanent. Here
you have the most important options: the choice for the <strong>font
size</strong>, the <strong>themes</strong> whenever your prefer light or dark
colouring. There are other preferences you can explore by
yourself. Once you are done, access again the World menu
...Background click &rarr; Save... to make your
preferences permanent. In this book, we keep the default Cuis-Smalltalk
theme, we suggest you to do the same so your environment reflects the
book screenshots.

<span id="Fun-with-window-placement"></span><h4 class="subsection">1.2.2 Fun with window placement</h4>
<span id="index-tools_002c-workspace"></span>
<p>The first tool to discover is the <em>Workspace</em> tool. It is a kind
of text editor to key in Smalltalk code you can execute
immediately. Do a ...Background click &rarr;
Open... &rarr; Workspace...
</p>
<p>Now we ask Cuis-Smalltalk to make the windows placement: click the blue icon
(top left) to access the window option and experiment with the white
area to place the Workspace window at the half left of the Cuis-Smalltalk
environment.

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong><em>Figure</em> 1.2: </strong>Window options</p></div></div>
<p>The <samp>resize...</samp> option even offers more freedom to place the
window. Resolve the following exercise:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="exePlacement"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p><em>Use the
<samp>resize...</samp> option to place the Workspace centered on Cuis-Smalltalk
environment.</em>
