<p>We already wrote about the Cuis-Smalltalk <em>image</em> (See <a href="Installing-and-configuring-Cuis_002dSmalltalk.html">Installing and configuring Cuis-Smalltalk</a>). When saving the state of the virtual machine in
the image file, every single change done in the environment will be
embodied in the saved image: this includes the windows in the
environment, Workspace contents, newly written classes and methods,
existing instances including the visual morphs, a debugging session
with a System Browser, an Inspector, etc.
</p>
<p>At any time, the user can save the image with ...World
menu &rarr; <code>Save</code>... Alternatively <code>Save as...</code> saves
the image under an alternate name provided by the user.
</p>
<p>Saving the image is the easiest and most straightforward method to save
your own code. But we can&rsquo;t really call that code management as your
code is not saved in a dedicated file of its own but mixed into other code in an
image. Moreover it will be unpractical to share your work with others,
for example via a version control system.
</p>
<p>For various reasons, an image may be in fuzzy state: the virtual
machine may crash when running it, the file system may be unstable,
or the environment may be in a lock
down state. This is a drawback when using the image as your sole
source code repository. The net result could be loosing your work.
</p>
<p>Where you lost code because of a virtual machine crash
there is a solution to recover your lost editing,
the <em>Change Log</em>.
