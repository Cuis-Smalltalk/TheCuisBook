<p>We already wrote about the Cuis-Smalltalk <em class="dfn">image</em> (See <a class="xref" href="Installing-and-configuring-Cuis_002dSmalltalk.html">Installing and configuring Cuis-Smalltalk</a>). When saving the state of the virtual machine in
the image file, every single change done in the environment will be
embodied in the saved image: this includes the windows in the
environment, Workspace contents, newly written classes and methods,
existing instances including the visual morphs, a debugging session
with a System Browser, an Inspector, etc.
</p>
<p>At any time, the user can save the image with ...World
menu &rarr; <code class="command">Save</code>... Alternatively <code class="command">Save as...</code> saves
the image under an alternate name provided by the user.
</p>
<p>Saving the image is the easiest and most straightforward method to
save your own code. But we can&rsquo;t really call that code management as
your code is not saved in a dedicated file of its own but mixed into
other code in an image. Moreover it will be unpractical to share your
work with others, for example via a version control system.
</p>
<p>For various reasons, an image may be in fuzzy state: the virtual
machine may crash when running it, the file system may be unstable, or
the environment may be in a lock down state. This is a drawback when
using the image as your sole source code repository. The net result
could be loosing your work.
</p>
<p>Where you lost code because of a virtual machine crash there is a
solution to recover your lost editing, the <em class="dfn">Change Log</em>.
