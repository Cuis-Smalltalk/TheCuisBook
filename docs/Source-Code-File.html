<p>In this chapter, you encountered files produced by the Cuis-Smalltalk
management tools. Some come with the extension <samp class="file">.pck.st</samp> and
others with the extension <samp class="file">.st</samp>. They both contain Smalltalk code
but serve different purposes.
</p>
<p>Files with extension <samp class="file">.pck.st</samp> are Cuis-Smalltalk package files. They
have a preamble with package information, like feature provided,
version information, a description for the package and the package
requirements.
</p>
<p>Smalltalk code files can be installed by selecting them in the File
List Browser and clicking on <code class="command">install</code> button.
</p>
<p>When a package is installed, its dependencies are also installed and
the loaded packaged appears in the Package List tool. Package files
<samp class="file">.pck.st</samp> are created using the Packages List tool in
Cuis-Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>Files with extension <samp class="file">.st</samp> contained serialized Smalltalk code &ndash;
classes and methods. They are created when you <em class="dfn">file out</em> a
Smalltalk system category, class or method. You can serialize code in
the System Browser by selecting a <strong class="strong">system
category</strong>, <strong class="strong">class</strong> or <strong class="strong">method</strong> &rarr; right click and
select <code class="command">fileOut</code> from the context menu.
</p>
<p>Unlike <samp class="file">.pck.st</samp> files, <samp class="file">.st</samp> files don&rsquo;t contain any
dependencies, description, or package information, only serialized
Smalltalk code. <samp class="file">.st</samp> files are around since Smalltalk’s early
days, while <samp class="file">.pkg.st</samp> were added with the Cuis-Smalltalk package
functionality.
</p>
<p>In addition to <code class="command">install</code>, selecting a code file in the File List
Browser also adds buttons to inspect the <code class="command">code</code> and to treat code
<code class="command">contents</code> like a Change Sorter. When inspecting the code, a
browser shows what code is different between the file and the running
image and allows one to import individual classes or methods with the
help of the context menu.
