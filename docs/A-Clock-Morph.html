<p>With all the things we have already learned, we can build a more
sophisticated morph. Let&rsquo;s build a <code>ClockMorph</code> as see in
<a href="#ch07_002d05_002dClock">Figure 7.5</a>. In order to have a default text font based on
vector graphics, do ...World menu &rarr;

</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.5: </strong>A clock morph</p></div></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create <code>ClockMorph</code>, the dial clock :

<span id="index-morph-21"></span>
<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="clockDialDrawing"></span>
<div class="display">

</pre></div>

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Example 7.2: </strong>Drawing the clock dial</p></div></div>

<p>We create <code>ClockHourHandMorph</code>, the hand for the hours:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">MovableMorph subclass: #ClockHourHandMorph
   instanceVariableNames: &rdquo;
   classVariableNames: &rdquo;
   poolDictionaries: &rdquo;
   category: &rsquo;Morphic-Learning&rsquo;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">ClockHourHandMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas fillColor: (Color black alpha: 0.6) do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: -10 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: 5;
         lineToX: 50 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: -5;
         lineToX: -10 y: 0 ].</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can start playing with them. We could use several instances of a
single <code>ClockHandMorph</code>, or create several classes. Here we
chose to do the latter. Note that all the <code>drawOn:</code> use
hardcoded constants for all coordinates. As we have seen before, this
is not a limitation. We don&rsquo;t need to write a lot of trigonometric and
scaling formulas to build Morphs in Cuis-Smalltalk!
</p>
<p>By now, you might imagine what we are doing with all this, but please
stick with us while we finish building our clock.
</p>
<p>We create <code>ClockMinuteHandMorph</code>, the hand for the minutes:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">MovableMorph subclass: #ClockMinuteHandMorph
   instanceVariableNames: &rdquo;
   classVariableNames: &rdquo;
   poolDictionaries: &rdquo;
   category: &rsquo;Morphic-Learning&rsquo;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">ClockMinuteHandMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas fillColor: ((Color black) alpha: 0.6) do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: -8 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: 4;
         lineToX: 82 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: -4;
         lineToX: -8 y: 0 ]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And finally, the <code>ClockSecondHandMorph</code>, the hand for the seconds:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">MovableMorph subclass: #ClockSecondHandMorph
   instanceVariableNames: &rdquo;
   classVariableNames: &rdquo;
   poolDictionaries: &rdquo;
   category: &rsquo;Morphic-Learning&rsquo;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">ClockSecondHandMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas strokeWidth: 1.5 color: Color red do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: 0 y: 0;
         lineToX: 85 y: 0 ]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, all that is needed is to put our clock parts together in
<code>ClockMorph</code>. In its method category <code>initialization</code> add
its <code>initialize</code> method (accept the new names as instance
variables):
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">ClockMorph&gt;&gt;initialize
   super initialize.
   self addMorph: (hourHand &#x2190; ClockHourHandMorph new).
   self addMorph: (minuteHand &#x2190; ClockMinuteHandMorph new).
   self addMorph: (secondHand &#x2190; ClockSecondHandMorph new)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, we animate it. In method category <code>stepping</code> add the
method:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">ClockMorph&gt;&gt;wantsSteps
   &#x2191; true</span>
</pre></div>

<p>...and:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">ClockMorph&gt;&gt;step
   | time |
   time &#x2190; Time now.
   hourHand rotation: (time hour * 30 - 90) degreesToRadians.
   minuteHand rotation: (time minute * 6 - 90) degreesToRadians.
   secondHand rotation: (time second * 6 - 90) degreesToRadians.</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Take a look at how we update the clock hands.
</p>
<p>As we said before, any <code>MovableMorph</code> defines a coordinate
system for its own <code>drawOn:</code> method and also for its
submorphs. This new coordinate system might include rotation or
reflexion of the axis, and scaling of sizes, but by default they
don&rsquo;t. This means that they just translate the origin, by specifying
where in the owner point <code>0@0</code> is to be located.
</p>
<p>The World coordinate system has <code>0@0</code> at the top left
corner, with X coordinates increasing to the right, and Y coordinates
increasing downwards. Positive rotations go clockwise. This is the
usual convention in graphics frameworks. Note that this is different
from the usual mathematics convention, where Y increases upwards, and
positive angles go counterclockwise.
</p>
<p>So, how do we update the hands? For example, for the hour hand, one
hour means 30 degrees, as 12 hours means 360 degrees or a whole
turn. We multiply hours by 30 to get degrees. But for 0 the hand must
point up, that is -90 degrees in our coordinate system. So we
substract 90. Then we convert to radians, the unit expected by the
<code>rotation:</code> method. Minute and second hand work in a similar
way, but as there are 60 minutes in one hour, and 60 seconds in one
minute, we need to multiply them by 6 to get degrees. As rotation is
done around the origin, and the clock has set the origin at its center
(<a href="#clockDialDrawing">Example 7.2</a>), there&rsquo;s no need to set the position of the
hands. Their <code>0@0</code> origin will therefore be at the clock
<code>0@0</code>, i.e. the center of the clock.

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.6: </strong>A fancy clock morph</p></div></div>
<div class="float"><span id="exeFancyClock"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p><em>Look at the clock on
<a href="#ch07_002d06_002dExerciseClock">Figure 7.6</a>. Don&rsquo;t you think its hand for the seconds
decorated with a red and yellow disc is fancy? How will you modify our
clock morph to get this result?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 7.4: </strong>A fancy clock</p></div></div>
<p>Create some instances of your clock: <code>ClockMorph new
openInWorld</code>. You can rotate and zoom. Look at the visual quality of
the Roman numerals in the clock face, especially when rotated and
zoomed. You don&rsquo;t get this graphics quality on your regular
programming environment! You can also extract the parts, or scale each
separately. Another fun experiment is to extract the Roman numerals
into a separate <code>ClockFaceMorph</code>, and make it submorph of the
Clock. Then, you can rotate just the face, not the clock, and the
clock will show fake time. Try it!
</p>

<p>You might have noted two things that seem missing, though: How to
compute bounding rectangles for Morphs, and how to detect if a Morph
is being hit by the Hand, so you can move it or get a halo. The
display rectangle that contains a morph is needed by the framework to
manage the areas of the Display that need to be updated as a result of
any change. But you don&rsquo;t need to know this rectangle in order to
build your own Morphs. In Cuis-Smalltalk, the framework computes it as
needed, and stores it in the <code>privateDisplayBounds</code>
variable. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about that variable at
all. <span id="index-to-be-written_002c-WRT_003a-what-is-it_003f"></span>
<strong>To be written.</strong> WRT: what is it? detecting if a Morph is hit by the Hand,
or more generally, if a pixel belongs to a Morph, truth is that when a
Morph is drawn, the framework indeed knows all the pixels it is
affecting. The <code>drawOn:</code> method already specifies the shape of
the Morph. Therefore, there is no need to ask the programmer to code
the Morph geometry again in a separate method! All that is needed is
careful design of the framework itself, to avoid requiring programmers
to handle this extra complexity.
</p>
<p>The ideas we have outlined in this chapter are the fundamental ones in
Morphic, and the framework is implemented in order to support
them. Morphs (i.e. interactive graphic objects) are very general and
flexible. They are not restricted to a conventional widgets library,
although such a library (rooted in <code>WidgetMorph</code>) is included
and used for building all the Smalltalk tools.
</p>
<p>The examples we have explored use the VectorGraphics package. This
package includes VectorCanvas and HybridCanvas classes. However,
installing this package is not required for using the regular
Smalltalk tools you have been using. The reason is that Cuis includes
by default the <code>BitBltCanvas</code> class inherited from Squeak (and
called <code>FormCanvas</code> there). <code>BitBltCanvas</code> doesn&rsquo;t support
the vector graphics drawing operations and doesn&rsquo;t do anti-aliasing or
zooming. But it is mature, and it relies on the BitBlt operation that
is included in the virtual machine. This means that it offers
excellent performance.
</p>
<p>VectorGraphics is still in active development. When its drawing
performance becomes good enough, it will be possible to draw all
Morphs, completely replacing BitBltCanvas. Then, the UI customization
option &rsquo;World&rsquo; / &rsquo;Preferences...&rsquo; / &rsquo;Font Sizes...&rsquo; will no longer be
needed, as all windows will be zoomable, in addition to resizable.
</p>
<p>To further explore Cuis&rsquo; Morphic, evaluate &lsquo;Feature require: &rsquo;SVG&rsquo;&lsquo;,
and then &lsquo;SVGElementMorph examplesLion&lsquo; and the other examples
there. Also, be sure to try the example in the comment in
#unicodeExamples.
