<span id="A-Clock-Morph-1"></span><h3 class="section">7.2 A Clock Morph</h3>
<p>With all the things we have already learned, we can build a more
sophisticated morph. Let&rsquo;s build a <code>ClockMorph</code> as see in
<a href="#ch07_002d05_002dClock">Figure 7.5</a>. In order to have a default text font based on
vector graphics, do ...World menu &rarr;
<code>Preferences...</code> &rarr; <code>Set System Font...</code> &rarr;
<code>DejaVu...</code> &rarr; <code>DejaVuSans</code><a id="DOCF22" href="#FOOT22"><sup>22</sup></a>.
</p>

<div class="float"><span id="ch07_002d05_002dClock"></span>
<div align="center"><img src="ch07-05-Clock.png" alt="ch07-05-Clock">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.5: </strong>A clock morph</p></div></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create <code>ClockMorph</code>, the dial clock :
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">MovableMorph subclass: #ClockMorph
   instanceVariableNames: ''
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Morphic-Learning'
</pre></div>

<span id="index-morph-21"></span>
<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="clockDialDrawing"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ClockMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas
      ellipseCenterX: 0 y: 0 rx: 100 ry: 100
      borderWidth: 10
      borderColor: Color lightCyan
      fillColor: Color veryVeryLightGray.
   aCanvas drawString: 'XII' at: -13 @ -90 font: nil color: Color brown.
   aCanvas drawString: 'III' at: 66 @ -10 font: nil color: Color brown.
   aCanvas drawString: 'VI' at: -11 @ 70 font: nil color: Color brown.
   aCanvas drawString: 'IX' at: -90 @ -10 font: nil color: Color brown
</pre></div>

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Example 7.2: </strong>Drawing the clock dial</p></div></div>

<p>We create <code>ClockHourHandMorph</code>, the hand for the hours:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">MovableMorph subclass: #ClockHourHandMorph
   instanceVariableNames: ''
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Morphic-Learning'
</pre></div>

<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ClockHourHandMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas fillColor: (Color black alpha: 0.6) do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: 0 y: 10;
         lineToX: -5 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: -50;
         lineToX: 5 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: 10 ].
</pre></div>

<p>You can start playing with them. We could use several instances of a
single <code>ClockHandMorph</code>, or create several classes. Here we
chose to do the latter. Note that all the <code>drawOn:</code> methods use
hardcoded constants for all coordinates. As we have seen before, this
is not a limitation. We don&rsquo;t need to write a lot of specialized trigonometric and
scaling formulas to build Morphs in Cuis-Smalltalk!
</p>
<p>By now, you might imagine what we are doing with all this, but please
bear with us while we finish building our clock.
</p>
<p>We create <code>ClockMinuteHandMorph</code>, the hand for the minutes:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">MovableMorph subclass: #ClockMinuteHandMorph
   instanceVariableNames: ''
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Morphic-Learning'
</pre></div>

<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ClockMinuteHandMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas fillColor: ((Color black) alpha: 0.6) do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: 0 y: 8;
         lineToX: -4 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: -82;
         lineToX: 4 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: 8 ]
</pre></div>

<p>And finally, the <code>ClockSecondHandMorph</code>, the hand for the seconds:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">MovableMorph subclass: #ClockSecondHandMorph
   instanceVariableNames: ''
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Morphic-Learning'
</pre></div>

<p>...and its drawing method in the category <code>drawing</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ClockSecondHandMorph&gt;&gt;drawOn: aCanvas
   aCanvas strokeWidth: 2.5 color: Color red do: [
      aCanvas
         moveToX: 0 y: 0;
         lineToX: 0 y: -85 ]
</pre></div>

<p>Now, all that is needed is to put our clock parts together in
<code>ClockMorph</code>. In its method category <code>initialization</code> add
its <code>initialize</code> method (accept the new names as instance
variables):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ClockMorph&gt;&gt;initialize
   super initialize.
   self addMorph: (hourHand := ClockHourHandMorph new).
   self addMorph: (minuteHand := ClockMinuteHandMorph new).
   self addMorph: (secondHand := ClockSecondHandMorph new)
</pre></div>

<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="note.png" alt="note">
If you have not already added instance variables for the
clock hands, the Cuis IDE will note this and ask what you want
to do about it.  We want to declare the three missing names as instance
variables.

</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.7: </strong><code>ClockMorph</code> with instance variables added</p></div></div>
<p>Finally, we animate our clock. In method category <code>stepping</code> add the
method:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ClockMorph&gt;&gt;wantsSteps
   ^ true
</pre></div>

<p>...and:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ClockMorph&gt;&gt;step
   | time |
   time := Time now.
   hourHand rotationDegrees: time hour * 30.
   minuteHand rotationDegrees: time minute * 6.
   secondHand rotationDegrees: time second * 6.
</pre></div>

<p>Take a look at how we update the clock hands.
</p>
<p>As we said before, any <code>MovableMorph</code> defines a coordinate
system for its own <code>drawOn:</code> method and also for its
submorphs. This new coordinate system might include rotation or
reflexion of the axis, and scaling of sizes, but by default they
don&rsquo;t. This means that they just translate the origin, by specifying
where in the owner point <code>0@0</code> is to be located.
</p>
<p>The World coordinate system has <code>0@0</code> at the top left
corner, with X coordinates increasing to the right, and Y coordinates
increasing downwards. Positive rotations go clockwise. This is the
usual convention in graphics frameworks. Note that this is different
from the usual mathematics convention, where Y increases upwards, and
positive angles go counterclockwise.
</p>
<p>So, how do we update the hands? For example, for the hour hand, one
hour means 30 degrees, as 12 hours means 360 degrees or a whole
turn. So, we multiply hours by 30 to get degrees. Minute and second hand
work in a similar way, but as there are 60 minutes in one hour, and 60
seconds in one minute, we need to multiply them by 6 to get degrees. As
rotation is done around the origin, and the clock has set the origin at its
center (<a href="#clockDialDrawing">Example 7.2</a>), there&rsquo;s no need to set the position of the
hands. Their <code>0@0</code> origin will therefore be at the clock
<code>0@0</code>, i.e. the center of the clock.

<div align="center"><img src="ch07-06-ExerciseClock.png" alt="ch07-06-ExerciseClock">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 7.8: </strong>A fancy clock morph</p></div></div>
<div class="float"><span id="exeFancyClock"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>Look at the clock on
<a href="#ch07_002d06_002dExerciseClock">Figure 7.8</a>. Don&rsquo;t you think its hand for the seconds
decorated with a red and yellow disc is fancy? How will you modify our
clock morph to get this result?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 7.5: </strong>A fancy clock</p></div></div>
<p>Create some instances of your clock: <code>ClockMorph new
openInWorld</code>. You can rotate and zoom. Look at the visual quality of
the Roman numerals in the clock face, especially when rotated and
zoomed. You don&rsquo;t get this graphics quality on your regular
programming environment! You can also extract the parts, or scale each
separately. Another fun experiment is to extract the Roman numerals
into a separate <code>ClockFaceMorph</code>, and make it submorph of the
Clock. Then, you can rotate just the face, not the clock, and the
clock will show fake time. Try it!
</p>
<p>You might have noted two things that seem missing, though: How to
compute bounding rectangles for Morphs, and how to detect if a Morph
is being hit by the Hand, so you can move it or get a halo. The
display rectangle that fully contains a morph is required by the framework
to manage the required refresh of Display areas as a result of
any change. But you don&rsquo;t need to know this rectangle in order to
build your own Morphs. In Cuis-Smalltalk, the framework computes it as
needed, and stores it in the <code>privateDisplayBounds</code>
variable. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about that variable at
all.
</p>
<p>With respect to detecting if a Morph is being touched by the Hand,
or more generally, if some pixel belongs to a Morph, truth is that during
the drawing operation of a Morph, the framework indeed knows all the
pixels it is affecting. The <code>drawOn:</code> method completely specifies
the shape of the Morph. Therefore, there is no need to ask the programmer
to code the Morph geometry again in a separate method! All that is needed
is careful design of the framework itself, to avoid requiring programmers to
handle this extra complexity.
</p>
<p>The ideas we have outlined in this chapter are the fundamental ones in
Morphic, and the framework is implemented in order to support
them. Morphs (i.e. interactive graphic objects) are very general and
flexible. They are not restricted to a conventional widget library,
although such a library (rooted in <code>WidgetMorph</code>) is included
and used for building all the Smalltalk tools.
</p>
<p>The examples we have explored use the <code>VectorGraphics</code>
package. This package includes <code>VectorCanvas</code> and
<code>HybridCanvas</code> classes. However, installing this package is not
required for using the regular Smalltalk tools you have been
using. The reason is that Cuis-Smalltalk includes by default the
<code>BitBltCanvas</code> class inherited from Squeak (and called
<code>FormCanvas</code> there). <code>BitBltCanvas</code> doesn&rsquo;t support the
vector graphics drawing operations and doesn&rsquo;t do anti-aliasing or
zooming. But it is mature, and it relies on the BitBlt operation that
is included in the <acronym>VM</acronym>. This means that it offers excellent
performance.
</p>
<p><code>VectorGraphics</code> is still in active development. When its drawing
performance becomes good enough, it will be able to draw all Morphs,
completely replacing BitBltCanvas. Then, the UI customization option
World menu &rarr; <code>Preferences...</code> &rarr;
<code>Font Sizes...</code> will no longer be needed, as all windows will be
zoomable, in addition to resizable.
</p>
<p>To further explore Cuis-Smalltalk&rsquo; Morphic, evaluate <code>Feature
require: 'SVG'</code>, and then <code>SVGElementMorph examplesLion</code> and
the other examples there. Also, be sure to try the example in the
comment in the <code>BitBltCanvas class&gt;&gt;unicodeExamples</code> and
<code>BitBltCanvas class&gt;&gt;unicodeUtf32Examples</code> methods.
