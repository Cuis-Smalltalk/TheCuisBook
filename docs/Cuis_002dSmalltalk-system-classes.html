<p>As we already wrote Cuis-Smalltalk is a pure object oriented environment. It
means that every single entities you are dealing with are represented
as instances of classes written in Cuis-Smalltalk itself. As a direct
consequence, Cuis-Smalltalk is mostly written in itself.  In the previous
section we read some details of the <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> class and both
instance and class side methods (<span class="sansserif">abs</span>, <span class="sansserif">squared</span> and
<span class="sansserif">numerator:denominator:</span>).
</p>
<p>What we call system classes are models of fundamental objects. In
other programming languages, it will be called standard library.
</p>
<p>To be honest, there is no such a distinction between system classes
and user classes, but it will help us to draw a boundary around the
most used objects. We will give a brief introduction to these classes
and the most important methods.
</p>
<p>The classes are organised in hierarchy grouped in categories. To
discover the most important classes, we use the browser to navigate
these categories in the left pane. Important categories to start with
are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>Kernel-Numbers</code>. Related to the different number
   representations and calculated, including mathematics functions,
   conversion, intervals and even iterations.
   
</li><li> <code>Kernel-Text</code>. Related to character and string as
   collection of characters.
   
</li><li> <code>Collections-Abstract</code>,
   <code>Collections-Unordered</code>, <code>Collections-Sequenceable</code>,
   <code>Collections-Arrayed</code>. Related to Array, Dictionary, dynamic
   collection as OrderedCollection and many more. It includes
   accessing, enumerators, mathematics functions, sorting.

</li></ul>
