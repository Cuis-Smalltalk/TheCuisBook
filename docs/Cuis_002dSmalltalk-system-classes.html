<p>As we noted above, Cuis-Smalltalk is a pure object oriented environment. This 
means that every single entitiy you are dealing with is represented
as an instances of a class written in Cuis-Smalltalk itself. As a direct
consequence, Cuis-Smalltalk is mostly written in itself.  This means
the entire system is open to you to learn and play with.
</p>
<p>What we call system classes are models of fundamental objects. In
other programming languages, these would be implemented in
that language&rsquo;s standard library.
</p>
<p>In a truely open system, there is no such a distinction between system classes
and user classes, but it will help us to draw a boundary around the
most used objects. Let&rsquo;s have a brief introduction to some fundamental
Smalltalk classes
and their most important methods.  Later we will cover
graphics, files, networking, and the user interface objects called Morphs.
</p>

<p>In the upper left pane of the Browser, Categories of classes important
to start with are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>Kernel-Numbers</code>. Related to the different number
   representations and calculations, including mathematics functions,
   conversion, intervals and even iterations.
   
</li><li> <code>Kernel-Text</code>. Related to character and string as
   collection of characters.
   
</li><li> The Collection classes:
   <div class="format">
<pre class="format">   <code>Collections-Abstract</code>,
   <code>Collections-Unordered</code>,
   <code>Collections-Sequenceable</code>,
   <code>Collections-Arrayed</code>.
   </pre></div>
<p>Related to Array, Dictionary, Set, OrderedCollection and many more.
   This category includes
   common accessing, enumeration, mathematical functions, and sorting.
</p>
</li></ul>
