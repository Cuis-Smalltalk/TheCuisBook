<span id="index-method-13"></span>

<p>Whereas expressions may be evaluated anywhere in Cuis-Smalltalk (for example 
in a workspace, in a debugger, or in a browser), methods are normally
defined in the System Browser window or in the Debugger. Methods can
also be filed in from an external medium, but this is not the usual
way to program in Cuis-Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>Programs are developed one method at a time, in the context of a given
class. A class is defined by sending a message to an existing class,
asking it to create a subclass, so there is no special syntax required
for defining classes. We are already farmiliar with this
from previous examples.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a another look to the method syntax when control flow is
involved &ndash; our first explanation was <a href="Spacewar_0021-States-and-Behaviors.html">Spacewar! States and Behaviors</a>).
</p>
<p>Here is the method <code>keyStroke:</code> in the class <code>SpaceWar</code>.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="spacewarKeyStroke"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">SpaceWar&gt;&gt;keyStroke: event
&quot;Check for any keyboard stroke, and take action accordingly&quot;
| key |
key := event keyCharacter.
key = Character arrowUp ifTrue: [^ ships first push].
key = Character arrowRight ifTrue: [^ ships first right].
key = Character arrowLeft ifTrue: [^ ships first left].
key = Character arrowDown ifTrue: [^ ships first fireTorpedo]
</pre></div>

<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Example 5.1: </strong>SpaceWar! key stroke</p></div></div>
<p>Syntactically, a method consists of:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the method pattern, containing the name (<em>i.e.</em>,
 <code>keyStroke:</code>) and any arguments. Here <code>event</code> is a
 <code>KeyboardEvent</code>,

</li><li> comments (these may occur anywhere, but the convention is to
 put one at the top that explains what the method does),
 
</li><li> declarations of local variables (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>key</code>),

</li><li> and any number of expressions separated by dots; here there are
 5.

</li></ul>

<p>The evaluation of any expression preceded by a ^ (typed as ^)
will cause the method to exit at that point, returning the value of
that expression. A method that terminates without explicitly returning
the value of some expression will always return the current
value of <code>self</code>.
</p>
<p>Arguments and local variables should always start with lower case
letters. Names starting with upper-case letters are assumed to be
global variables. Class names, like <code>Character</code>, for example,
are simply global variables referring to the object representing
that class.
</p>
<p>As you might suspect from <a href="Communicating-entities.html#classesCount">Example 2.2</a>, <code>Smalltalk allClasses size</code> just
sends the <code>#allClasses</code> method to a dictionary named <code>Smalltalk</code>.
As with any other object, you can inspect this dictionary.  You can note a case of
self-reference here: the value of <code>Smalltalk at: #Smalltalk</code> is <code>Smalltalk</code>.
