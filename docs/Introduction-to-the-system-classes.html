<h3 class="section">1.3 Introduction to the system classes</h3>
<p>Cuis-Smalltalk is a pure object oriented language: all the entities as
integer, float, rational number, string, collection, block of code we
discovered in the previous section are objects.
</p>
<p>But what is an object? An object is an entity responding to two
criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>An internal state.</strong> It is materialized by variable(s)
   known only by the object. A variable only visible within the object
   is called <em>private</em>. As a consequence, it is impossible &ndash; if
   the object decides so &ndash; to know the internal state of the object
   from another object.

</li><li> <strong>A behavior.</strong> It is modeled by message(s) &ndash; we
   already used this vocabulary &ndash; sent to the object. When the object
   receives a message it understands, it executes the code of an
   internal method named as the message.

</li></ul>
<a name="index-class"></a>
<a name="index-instance"></a>

<p>Several entities sharing the same variables and messages understanding
are very likely to exist within Cuis-Smalltalk &ndash; think about the
numbers. Therefore, entities are created &ndash; <em>instantiated</em> &ndash;
following a model, this model is called a <em>Class</em>.
</p>
<p>A specific class declares the internal variables and the behavior by
implementing the methods. Let see how the <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> is declared:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Number subclass: #Fraction
   instanceVariableNames: &rsquo;numerator denominator&rsquo;
   classVariableNames: &rdquo;
   poolDictionaries: &rdquo;
   category: &rsquo;Kernel-Numbers&rsquo;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As expected there are two variables &ndash; named <em>instance variables</em>
&ndash; to define the <span class="sansserif">numerator</span> and <span class="sansserif">denominator</span> of
a fraction. From this declaration, we observe there is a hierarchy in
the class definition: <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> is a kind of
<span class="sansserif">Number</span>. This mean a fraction inherits the internal state &ndash;
variables &ndash; and behavior &ndash; methods &ndash; defined in the <span class="sansserif">Number</span>
class.
</p>
<p>This aspect of object oriented programming is called
<em>inheritance</em>. In Cuis-Smalltalk, each class inherits from one parent
class.
</p>
<a name="index-instance_002c-creation"></a>
<p>In the previous section, we already met fraction. Those fractions are
objects called <em>instance</em> of the class <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>. To create
this instance we wrote <span class="sansserif">5 / 4</span>, the mechanism is based on
message sending and polymorphism. The number <span class="sansserif">5</span> is an
integer receiving the message <span class="sansserif">#/</span>, therefore looking at the method
<span class="sansserif">/</span> in the <span class="sansserif">Integer</span> class explains how is instantiated
the fraction. See part of this method, we remove intentionally part of
its source code:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">/ aNumber
&quot;Refer to the comment in Number / &quot;
| quoRem |
aNumber isInteger ifTrue:
../..
   ifFalse: [^ (Fraction numerator: self denominator: aNumber) reduced]].
../..</span>
</pre></div>


<a name="index-class_002c-class-method"></a>
<p>We learn that in some situation, the method returns a fraction,
reduced. We can expect that in some other situation an integer is
returned, for example <span class="sansserif">6 / 2</span>.
</p>
<p>In the example, we observe the message <span class="sansserif">#numerator:denominator:</span> is
sent to the class <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span>, such a message refers to a
<em>class method</em> understood only by the <span class="sansserif">Fraction</span> class. It
is expected such a named method returns an instance of a Fraction.
</p>
<p>Try out in a workspace:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Fraction numerator: 24 denominator: 21
&rArr; 24/21</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Observe how the fraction is not reduced, where as it is with this code:
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">24 / 21
&rArr; 8/7</span>
</pre></div>
