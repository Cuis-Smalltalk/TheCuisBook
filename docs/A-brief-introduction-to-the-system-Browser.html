<span id="index-tools-2"></span>
<span id="index-browser"></span>

<p>Smalltalk organizes instance behaviors using classes.  
A class is an object which holds a set of methods to be executed
when one of its instances receives a message
that is the name of one of these methods.
</p>
<p>The <em>System Browser</em>, in short the <em>Browser</em>, is a tool to
rule all the classes in Cuis-Smalltalk. It is both a tool to explore the
classes (system or user ones) and to write new classes and methods.
</p>
<p>To access the tool ...World menu &rarr;
<code>Open...</code> &rarr; <code>Browser</code>...
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="ch02_002dbrowserDetailed"></span>
<div align="center"><img src="ch02-browserDetailed.png" alt="ch02-browserDetailed">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.1: </strong>The System Browser</p></div></div>
<span id="index-browser-1"></span>
<span id="index-class-1"></span>
<p>At the top left are the <em>class categories</em>, groups of classes
sharing the same theme. A category can also be used to create a
<em>Package</em>, which is an organisational element to save code in a
file system.  In <a href="#ch02_002dbrowserDetailed">Figure 2.1</a>, the selected class
category is <strong>Kernel-Numbers</strong>, a group of classes we already
started using. The term <strong>Kernel-</strong> indicates it is part of
fundamental categories, but it is only a convention. See the other
categories such as <strong>Kernel-Text</strong> and <strong>Kernel-Chronology</strong>
related to text and date entities.
</p>
<span id="index-class-2"></span>
<p>Next to the right are the classes in the selected class category. They
are nicely presented in a parent-child class hierarchy. When a class is
first selected in this pane, its declaration appears in the large pane
below, the <code>Number</code> class declaration is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Magnitude subclass: #Number
   instanceVariableNames: ''
   classVariableNames: ''
   poolDictionaries: ''
   category: 'Kernel-Numbers'
</pre></div>

<p>A few important points in this declaration:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <em><code>Number</code></em> is a subclass of <em><code>Magnitude</code></em>.
   This means
   <code>Number</code> is a kind of specialized <code>Magnitude</code>.

</li><li> the declaration itself is Smalltalk code, indeed the message
   <code>#subclass:instanceVariableNames:classVariableNames:...</code>
   was sent to <code>Magnitude</code> to create this class.

</li><li> the <code>subclass:</code> argument <code>Number</code> is prefixed
   with &ldquo;#&rdquo;. It is a symbol, a kind of unique string. Indeed when
   declaring the <code>Number</code> class, the system does not know about it
   yet, so it is named as a symbol.

</li><li> The <code>instanceVariableNames:</code> argument is a string:
   the instance variables of the class are declared by names separated
   by a space. There are none in this class definition.

</li></ul>

<p>A subclass inherits behaviors from its parent superclass, and so only needs
to describe what is different from its superclass.  An instance
of <code>Number</code> adds methods (which define behaviors) unknown to an instance
of <code>Magnitude</code>.  We will explore this in detail as we go forward.
</p>
<span id="index-class-3"></span>
<p>To learn about the purpose of a class, it is good practice to <strong>always</strong>
visit the class comment. Often a comment also comes with code
examples to learn how to use the object; these code snippets can be
selected and executed in place as done from a Workspace. In
<a href="#ch02_002dbrowserDetailed">Figure 2.1</a>, see the <code>comment</code> button to read or
to edit the comment of the selected class.
</p>
<span id="index-method-1"></span>
<p>To the right of the class panel is the method categories panel.
A class may have many methods, so grouping
them by category helps other users orient themselves in finding related methods.
As a reference, <code>Number</code>
has more than 100 instance side methods implemented in
itself<a id="DOCF13" href="#FOOT13"><sup>13</sup></a>. Clicking the <code>arithmetic</code> category
directly gives access to related methods in the next and last pane at
the right.
</p>
<span id="index-class-4"></span>
<span id="index-keyboard-shortcut-3"></span>

<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="note.png" alt="note">
A right click on the Class Category pane
brings up its context menu.  You can select <code>find class ..</code> or,
as the menu indicates, use <kbd>Ctrl-f</kbd> (<em><b>F</b>ind</em>), to get a
fill-in panel and type part of a class name to match.  Try it with
<code>String</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<div class="float"><span id="stringArith"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="CuisLogo.png" alt="CuisLogo">
<em>How many methods are there
in the <strong>arithmetic</strong> method category of the <code>String</code>
class?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 2.3: </strong>Count of methods</p></div></div>

<span id="index-method-2"></span>
<p>In the Browser, once a method is selected &ndash; as in
<a href="#ch02_002dbrowserDetailed">Figure 2.1</a>, <code>abs</code> method &ndash; the bottom part
shows its source code, ready to be explored or edited. Often,
you will find a small comment just after the method name,
surrounded by double quotes.
</p>
<p>Every object knows its own class and will respond with it when sent the message <code>#class</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-browser-2"></span>
<span id="index-keyboard-shortcut-4"></span>
<p><strong>Tip.</strong> In the workspace <kbd>Ctrl-b</kbd> (<em><b>B</b>rowse</em>)
on the class name will open a Browser on the named class:
</p>
<ul>
<li> In the Workspace, type <code>2 class</code> and print
   with <kbd>Ctrl-p</kbd>,

</li><li> <code>SmallInteger</code> is printed and automatically highlighted as the current selection,

</li><li> Invoke the Browser on the selected <code>SmallInteger</code>
   class with <kbd>Ctrl-b</kbd>,

</li><li> A new Browser instance opens on the <code>SmallInteger</code>, ready to
   be explored.

</li></ul>

<p>When considering its parents, the combined method count is
more than 300.</p>
