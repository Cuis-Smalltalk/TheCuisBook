<p>Smalltalk organizes instance behaviors using classes.  
A class is an object which holds the methods which react to
the messages which are their names.
</p>
<p>The <em>System Browser</em>, in short the <em>Browser</em>, is a tool to
rule all the classes in Cuis-Smalltalk. It is both a tool to explore the
classes (system or user ones) and to write new classes and methods.
</p>
<p>To access the tool, ...Background click &rarr;
<code>Open...</code> &rarr; <code>Browser</code>...
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="ch02_002dbrowserDetailed"></span>
<div align="center"><img src="ch02-browserDetailed.png" alt="ch02-browserDetailed">
</div>
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 2.1: </strong>The System Browser</p></div></div>
<span id="index-browser_002c-class-category"></span>
<span id="index-class_002c-category"></span>
<p>At the top left are the <em>class categories</em>, there are group of
classes part of the same theme. A caregory can also be used to
create a <em>Package</em>, which is
an organisational element to save code in a file system.
In <a href="#ch02_002dbrowserDetailed">Figure 2.1</a>, the
selected class category is <code>Kernel-Numbers</code>, a group of
classes we already started using. The term <code>Kernel-</code> indicates it
is part of fundamental categories, but it is only a convention. See
the other categories as <code>Kernel-Text</code> and
<code>Kernel-Chronology</code> related to text and date entities.
</p>
<span id="index-class_002c-declaration"></span>
<p>Next to the right are the classes in the selected class category. They
are nicely presented in a parent-child class hierarchy. When a class is
first selected in this pane, its declaration appears in the large pane
bellow, the <span class="sansserif">Number</span> class declaration is:
</p>
<div class="display">
<pre class="display"><span class="sansserif">Magnitude subclass: #Number
   instanceVariableNames: &rdquo;
   classVariableNames: &rdquo;
   poolDictionaries: &rdquo;
   category: &rsquo;Kernel-Numbers&rsquo;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Observe a few important points in this declaration:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <span class="sansserif">Number</span> is a subclass of <span class="sansserif">Magnitude</span>. This means
   <span class="sansserif">Number</span> is a kind of specialized <span class="sansserif">Magnitude</span>.

</li><li> the declaration itself is Smalltalk code, indeed the message
   <span class="sansserif">#subclass:instanceVariableNames:classVariableNames:poolDictionaries:
   category:</span> was sent to <span class="sansserif">Magnitude</span> to create this class.

</li><li> the <span class="sansserif">subclass:</span> argument <span class="sansserif">Number</span> is prefixed
   with &ldquo;#&rdquo;, it is a symbol, a kind of unique string. Indeed when
   declaring the <span class="sansserif">Number</span> class, the system does not know about it
   yet, so it is named as a symbol.

</li><li> The <span class="sansserif">instanceVariableNames:</span> argument is a string:
   the instance variables of the class are declared by name separated
   by a space. There are none in this class definition.

</li></ul>

<p>A subclass inherits behaviors from its parent superclass, and so only needs
to describe what is different from its superclass.  An instance
of <span class="sansserif">Number</span> adds methods (which define behaviors) unknown to an instance
of <span class="sansserif">Magnitude</span>.  We will explore this in detail as we go forward.
</p>
<span id="index-class_002c-comment"></span>
<p>To learn about the intend of a class, it is good practice to <strong>always</strong>
visit the class comment. Often a comment comes also with code
examples to learn how to use the object; these code snippets can be
selected and executed in place as done from a Workspace. In
<a href="#ch02_002dbrowserDetailed">Figure 2.1</a>, see the <code>comment</code> button to read or
to edit the comment of the selected class.
</p>
<span id="index-method_002c-category"></span>
<p>To the right of the class panel is the method categories panel.
A class may have with tens of methods, so grouping
them by category helps other users orient to find related methods.
As a reference, <span class="sansserif">Number</span>
has more than 100 instance side methods implemented in
itself<a id="DOCF10" href="#FOOT10"><sup>10</sup></a>. Clicking the <code>arithmetic</code> category
directly gives access to related methods in the next and last pane at
the right.
</p>
<div class="float"><span id="stringArith"></span>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p><em>How many methods is there
in the <code>arithmetic</code> method category of the <span class="sansserif">String</span>
class?</em>
</p></blockquote>


<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Exercise 2.3: </strong>Count of methods</p></div></div>
<span id="index-class_002c-category-1"></span>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> A right click on the Class Category pane brings up
its context menu.  You can select &ldquo;find class ..&rdquo; or, as the menu indictes,
use <kbd>Ctrl-f</kbd> (<em><b>F</b>ind</em>), to get a fill-in panel and type part of
a class name to match.  Try it with <span class="sansserif">String</span>.
</p>

<span id="index-class_002c-instance-method"></span>
<p>In the Browser, once a method is selected &ndash; in
<a href="#ch02_002dbrowserDetailed">Figure 2.1</a>, <span class="sansserif">abs</span> method &ndash; the bottom part
shows its source code, ready to be explored or edited. Again, often,
you will read a small comment just after the method name, it is
surrounded by double quotes.
</p>
<p>Every entity knows its class and answers it to the message <span class="sansserif">#class</span>.
</p>
<span id="index-browser_002c-invoke-from-Workspace"></span>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> in the workspace <kbd>Ctrl-b</kbd> (<em><b>B</b>rowse</em>)
on the class name will open a Browser on the named class:
</p>
<ul>
<li> In the Workspace, type <span class="sansserif">2 class</span> and print
   with <kbd>Ctrl-p</kbd>,

</li><li> <span class="sansserif">SmallInteger</span> is printed and automatically highlighted as the current selection,

</li><li> Invoke the Browser on the selected <span class="sansserif">SmallInteger</span>
   class with <kbd>Ctrl-b</kbd>,

</li><li> A new Browser instance opens on the <span class="sansserif">SmallInteger</span>, ready to
   be explored.

</li></ul>

<div class="footnote">

<h5><a id="FOOT10" href="#DOCF10">(10)</a></h3>
<p>When considering its parents, the combined method count is
more than 300.</p>
