<span id="System-Events-1"></span><h3 class="section">8.1 System Events</h3>

<p>Modern integrated <em>System On a Chip</em> (<em>SOC</em>) hardware has many
circuits which are active at the same time.  So one kind of event is
sensing something happening in the world.  Class <code>EventSensor</code>
handles keyboard key press and mouse <em>hardware interrupts</em>,
translating between hardware signals and software event objects.
</p>
<p>Basically, a morph <em>raises its hand</em> and says what events, if
any, it is interested in receiving. Then it implements methods to get
the event objects holding the information of the captured events. In
Cuis-Smalltalk, the class <code>MorphicEvent</code> and its subclasses represent
the diversity of events in the system.
</p>
<span id="index-event-2"></span>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format"><code>MorphicEvent</code>
   <code>DropEvent</code>
   <code>DropFilesEvent</code>
   <code>UserInputEvent</code>
      <code>KeyboardEvent</code>
      <code>MouseEvent</code>
         <code>MouseButtonEvent</code>
         <code>MouseMoveEvent</code>
         <code>MouseScrollEvent</code>
      <code>WindowEvent</code>
</pre></div>


<p>As <code>MouseMoveEvent</code>s are generated, the <code>HandMorph</code>
adjusts its screen position.  When mouse and keystroke events arrive,
the <code>HandMorph</code> coordinates the &ldquo;dispatch&rdquo; of events to the
proper morph under the hand as well as displaying tool tips and
carrying morphs in transit during drag operations.
</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous chapter with <code>ColorClickEllipse</code>, any
morph may override default <code>Morph</code> methods to assert that it
handles various user events and the methods which take the associated
event objects when events arrive.
</p>
<p>Basically, user input events are generated, a <code>HandMorph</code>
reflects any cursor movement, morphs react to events, each long
running task gets a time slice and makes some progress, any display
changes are updated on the screen, and the next step happens.  Time
marches forward a step.
</p>
<p>This happens over and over and over, keeping the juggler&rsquo;s illusion
that all balls in the air are moving at once.  Underneath, the balls
are each moving just a bit, in sequence.
