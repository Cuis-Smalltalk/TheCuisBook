<h3 class="section" id="System-Events-1">8.1 System Events</h3>

<p>Modern integrated <em class="dfn">System On a Chip</em> (<em class="dfn">SOC</em>) hardware has many
circuits which are active at the same time.  So one kind of event is
sensing something happening in the world.  Class <code class="code">EventSensor</code>
handles keyboard key press and mouse <em class="dfn">hardware interrupts</em>,
translating between hardware signals and software event objects.
</p>
<p>Basically, a morph <em class="emph">raises its hand</em> and says what events, if
any, it is interested in receiving. Then it implements methods to get
the event objects holding the information of the captured events. In
Cuis-Smalltalk, the class <code class="code">MorphicEvent</code> and its subclasses represent
the diversity of events in the system.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-event-2"></a>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format-preformatted"><code class="code">MorphicEvent</code>
   <code class="code">DropEvent</code>
   <code class="code">DropFilesEvent</code>
   <code class="code">UserInputEvent</code>
      <code class="code">KeyboardEvent</code>
      <code class="code">MouseEvent</code>
         <code class="code">MouseButtonEvent</code>
         <code class="code">MouseMoveEvent</code>
         <code class="code">MouseScrollEvent</code>
      <code class="code">WindowEvent</code>
</pre></div>


<p>As <code class="code">MouseMoveEvent</code>s are generated, the <code class="code">HandMorph</code>
adjusts its screen position.  When mouse and keystroke events arrive,
the <code class="code">HandMorph</code> coordinates the &ldquo;dispatch&rdquo; of events to the
proper morph under the hand as well as displaying tool tips and
carrying morphs in transit during drag operations.
</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous chapter with <code class="code">ColorClickEllipse</code>, any
morph may override default <code class="code">Morph</code> methods to assert that it
handles various user events and the methods which take the associated
event objects when events arrive.
</p>
<p>Basically, user input events are generated, a <code class="code">HandMorph</code>
reflects any cursor movement, morphs react to events, each long
running task gets a time slice and makes some progress, any display
changes are updated on the screen, and the next step happens.  Time
marches forward a step.
</p>
<p>This happens over and over and over, keeping the juggler&rsquo;s illusion
that all balls in the air are moving at once.  Underneath, the balls
are each moving just a bit, in sequence.
