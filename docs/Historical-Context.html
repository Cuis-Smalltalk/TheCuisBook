<span id="Historical-Context-1"></span><h3 class="section">1.1 Historical Context</h3>

<p>These ideas are not new, but they are not the basis of mainstream
approaches to software development. The first clear vision of an
automated information processor that would help people think and share
knowledge in greately improved ways, was the Memex described by
Vannevar Bush in &quot;As We May Think&quot;, published in 1945
<a id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This
ideas inspired many later thinkers and inventors. The most
straightforward development of this was the adoption of digital
computers and networks as the substrate for Memex like
systems. Notable milestones in this line of development were Ivan
Sutherland&rsquo;s Sketchpad (1963), the RAND Tablet (1964), and Doug
Engelbart&rsquo;s NLS (&quot;oN-Line System&quot;) (1968). Later developments include
Ted Nelson&rsquo;s Xanadu, the Apple Macintosh, the World Wide Web, and
Smartphones and Tablet computers.
</p>
<p>But, originally inspired by the Memex and the first wave of
developments listed above, another completely different vision was
developed. This vision was also influenced by the work on
understanding how humans learn of J. Piaget, J. Brunner, O. K. Moore
and S. Papert. Alan Kay conceived the idea that computer software and
computer programming could become a new medium for expressing thoughts
and knowledge. Therefore, the ability to express ideas in this new
medium would be the new literacy. Every person should learn to read
and write in this medium, at least to the extent of their personal
needs. He called his concept the &quot;Dynabook&quot; and described it in
&quot;Personal Dynamic Media&quot; (1977)
<a id="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>.
Another essential reading by Alan is
&quot;The Early History of Smalltalk&quot;
<a id="DOCF4" href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>Note the stark contrast with the mainstream point of view on
programming, where programming is merely giving a computer a set of
instructions so it can solve some problem. In this more common point
of view, the only value of software is to solve a problem, and it is
only as interesting as solving that problem. Furthermore, programming
is left to a professional guild whose technical knowledge is how to
write software.
</p>
<p>The Dynabook vision included two main parts: hardware and
software. Their original development took place at the Xerox PARC
research center, in the 1970&rsquo;s. The first &quot;interim Dynabook&quot; hardware
was the Xerox Alto, usually considered the first Personal
Computer. The software part was Smalltalk. The design of both was
guided by the objectives of making &quot;Personal Dynamic Media&quot; and the
Dynabook real. The final version of Smalltalk built at Xerox was
Smalltalk-80.
</p>
<p>Hardware has evolved a lot in the following decades. Smartphones,
Tablets and Laptops have effectively reached the kind of capabilities
a Dynabook was envisioned to have. However, the same hasn&rsquo;t happened
for software. After Smalltalk-80, further development of Smalltalk
only meant making it an appropriate tool for professional software
developers to write software for end users. Little has been advanced
in the idea of a new medium for people to express ideas.
</p>
<p>The development of the World Wide Web, and modern applications for
handhelds and laptops, and the disappearance of most &quot;end user
programming&quot; tools, meant that software is only written by
professional developers: the kinds of media that are made available
for users to create content include text, photographs and video, but
not a more advanced way to express knowledge.
</p>
<p>We believe that everyone should have full access to the software that
runs our systems.  Understanding and exploring computer systems requires
writing software in ways that can be read and shared.
</p>
<p>Dan Ingalls, one of the early Smalltalk system developers, wrote an article
in 1981 titled &quot;Design Principles Behind Smalltalk&quot; 
<a id="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>
which sets forth some principles that still guide us today.
</p>
<p>Among these:
</p>
<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="note.png" alt="note">
Personal Mastery: If a system is to serve the creative spirit,
it most be entirely comprehensible to a single individual.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="indentedblock">
<p>&nbsp;<img src="note.png" alt="note">
Reactive Principle: Every component accessible to the user should
be able to present itself in a meaningful way for observation
and manipulation.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This way of thinking about software systems is important to us.
</p>
<p>For this reason, Cuis is a Smalltalk system, and one that is rather
close to Smalltalk-80. It is well adapted to modern hardware and
operating environments, and includes many modern programming
facilities.
</p>
<p>We still believe that the best way to write programs is to capture
a set of ideas and knowledge, that other people can understand, and
that a computer can run. Cuis-Smalltalk is meant to be used this way.
