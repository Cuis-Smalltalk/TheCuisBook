<span id="Historical-Context-1"></span><h3 class="section">1.1 Historical Context</h3>

<p>One major idea in software is that programming is merely giving a
computer a set of instructions to solve some problem.  In this point
of view, the only value of software is to achieve a result, and it is
only as interesting as solving that problem.  Furthermore, programming
is left to a professional guild whose technical knowledge is how to
write software.
<span id="index-note_002c-Can-we-simplify_003f-Solve-is-repeated-3-times_002e"></span>
<strong>Note:</strong> <em>Can we simplify? Solve is repeated 3 times.</em>
</p>
<p>Our focus is on one thread in the history of powerful ideas which give
a different lens through which to explore software development than
the <em>just solve a problem</em> view. We think they are worth
revisiting. 
</p>
<p>The first clear vision of an automated information processor to assist
people to think and to share knowledge in greatly improved ways was
called Memex and described in Vannevar Bush essay &ldquo;As We May Think&rdquo;,
1945 <a id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
His ideas inspired many later thinkers and inventors in the adoption
of digital computers, networks and hypertext as the substrate for
Memex-like systems.  <a id="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Originally inspired by Memex, another vision was also developed with
insights in understanding how humans learn.  <a id="DOCF4" href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>  Alan Kay
conceived the idea that computer software and computer programming
could become a new medium for expressing thoughts and knowledge. The
ability to express ideas in this new medium would be the new
literacy. Every person should learn to read and write in this new
medium, at least to the extent of their personal needs. He called his
concept the <em>Dynabook</em> and described it in &ldquo;Personal Dynamic
Media&rdquo;, 1977
<a id="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>.
Other useful insights shared by Kay can be gleaned from his paper
&ldquo;The Early History of Smalltalk&rdquo;
<a id="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>The dynamic book vision &ndash; Dynabook &ndash; included two main parts:
hardware and software. The original development took place at the
Xerox PARC research center, in the 1970&rsquo;s. The first <em>interim
Dynabook</em> hardware was the Xerox Alto, usually considered the first
personal computer. The software part was Smalltalk. The design of both
was guided by the objectives of making <em>Personal Dynamic Media</em>
and the Dynabook real. The final version of Smalltalk built at Xerox
was Smalltalk-80.
</p>
<p>Given the relatively weak capabilities of computer hardware at this
time, implementing this vision presented real challenges, and much
creativity was called for.  Today, smartphones, tablets and laptops
have the hardware capabilities a Dynabook requires. However, the same
advance hasn&rsquo;t happened for personal software. After Smalltalk-80,
evolution was directed mostly toward making Smalltalk an appropriate
tool for professional developers to write software for end users. Only
a modest effort has been undertaken toward the idea of a new medium
for people to express ideas.
</p>
<p>The development of the World Wide Web with modern applications for
handhelds and laptops, along with the disappearance of most <em>end
user programming</em> tools, meant that software is almost exclusively
written by professional developers. The kinds of media that are made
available for users to create content include text, photographs and
video, but not a more advanced way to capture lessons learned, where
the user can <em>see all the way to the bottom</em> of what is going on
and be able to develop their own tools as required.
<span id="index-note_002c-_0060_0060capture-lessons-learned_0027_0027-is-too-obscure_002e-Elaborate"></span>
<strong>Note:</strong> <em>&ldquo;capture lessons learned&rdquo; is too obscure. Elaborate</em>
</p>

<p>We believe that everyone should have full access to the software that
runs our systems.  Understanding and exploring computer systems
requires writing software in ways that can be read and shared.
</p>

<p>The thinking change in problem solving can shift from <em>What can I
do here with what I am presented?</em> to asking <em>What tools do I
need to be successful here?</em>  and then building them to be ever more
successful.
</p>
<p>Dan Ingalls, one of the early Smalltalk inventors, wrote in his
article &ldquo;Design Principles Behind Smalltalk&rdquo;, 1981
<a id="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a>
a set of principles that still guide us today. Among these:
</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Personal Mastery.</strong> If a system is to serve the creative
spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual.
</p>
<p><strong>Reactive Principle.</strong> Every component accessible to the user
should be able to present itself in a meaningful way for observation
and manipulation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<div align="center">&mdash; <em>Dan Ingalls</em>
</div>
<p>This way of thinking about software systems is important to us.
</p>
<p>For this reason, Cuis is a Smalltalk system which is still rather
close to Smalltalk-80. It is well adapted to modern hardware and
operating environments, and includes many modern programming
facilities.
<span id="index-note_002c-the-latter-statement-is-vague_002e"></span>
<strong>Note:</strong> <em>the latter statement is vague.</em>
</p>
<p>We believe the best way to write programs is to capture a set of ideas
and knowledge other people can understand, and that a computer can
run. Cuis-Smalltalk is meant to be used this way.
<span id="index-note_002c-it-is-very-vague-too_002e"></span>
<strong>Note:</strong> <em>it is very vague too.</em>

<p>Notable milestones in this line of
development were Ivan Sutherland&rsquo;s Sketchpad (1963), the RAND tablet
(1964), and Doug Engelbart&rsquo;s NLS (&quot;oN-Line System&quot;) (1968). Later
